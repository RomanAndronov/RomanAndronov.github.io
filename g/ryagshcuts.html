    <h1>g Shortcuts</h1>

    <p>
    While any Euclidean straight edge and compass construction can be documented
    with \(g\), it may produce a large number of intermediate objects which,
    however useful, are overall irrelevant. In order to not pollute such a
    construction with these types of objects it is possible to omit them
    altogether by using \(g\) shortcuts which are compound statements that,
    while lacking all the required details, still capture the essence of the
    operation at hand.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, in <strong>Ruler and Compass 02</strong> section we document
    the steps for constructing perpendiculars and parallels. Here is a full
    <strong>3</strong>-step construction of a perpendicular to a given straight
    line \(l\) through a given point \(A\) on \(l\):
    </p>

$$Cir(O \notin l, OA) \cap l = A, B$$
$$Ln(B, O) \cap Cir(O, OA) = B, C$$
$$Ln(C, A) \bot l$$

    <p>
    We see that in addition to two given objects we generate five more: three
    points, a circle and a straight line. Since the sole objective of this
    construction is to demonstrate exactly how to solve a given problem, we
    have no choice but enumerate all the steps - without them there is no
    solution.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, if constructing a perpendicular through a point on a straight line
    is just an intermediate step in a larger solution of a bigger problem and
    the above mentioned five intermediate objects are not used during the
    remaining steps it is permissible to compress the above steps into a shortcut.
    </p>

    <p>
    We can record this shortcut as:
    </p>

$$C \notin l \colon Ln(A \in l, C) \bot l$$

    <p>
    which formally reads as:
    </p>

    <p class="center">
    <dfn>construct a point \(C\) not on \(l\) such that a straight line passing
    through \(A\) on \(l\) and through \(C\) is perpendicular to \(l\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Such shortcuts, however, will never be used in a vacuum - there will always
    be enough context in the course of a given construction to unambiguously place
    or locate the shortcut's objects. As such, it is permissible to compress most
    of the shortcuts even further. For example:
    </p>

$$C \colon Ln(A, C) = p \bot l$$

    <p>
    means:
    </p>

    <p class="center">
    <dfn>construct a perpendicular \(p\) to \(l\) through \(A\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    To construct an arbitrary circle through \(A\) perpendicular to \(l\), we
    may use the following shortcut:
    </p>

$$O \colon Cir(O, OA) = p \bot l$$

    <p>
    meaning:
    </p>

    <p class="center">
    <dfn>construct a circle \(p\) perpendicular to \(l\) through \(A\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    We see that a shortcut captures exactly what is being constructed in the
    smallest and most economical way possible without sacrificing the geometrical
    correctness of the process. However, at any time it is possible to inflate
    any shortcut and expose all of its underlying details.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here are several more shortcuts for popular primitive constructions.
    </p>

    <p>
    A perpendicular to a straight line through a point <dfn>not</dfn> on it:
    </p>

$$D \colon Ln(A \notin l, D) = p \bot l$$

    <p>
    or simply:
    </p>
    
$$D \colon Ln(A, D) = p \bot l$$
    
    <p>
    A parallel to a straight line through a point:
    </p>

$$E \colon Ln(A, E) \| l$$

    <p>
    A perpendicular bisector to a line segment:
    </p>

$$C, D, E \colon Ln(C, D) \bot Ln(A, B), AE = EB$$

    <p>
    An angle bisector:
    </p>

$$D \subset \angle ABC \colon \angle ABD = \angle CBD$$

    <p>
    A tangent to a circle through a point \(A\) not on the circumference of that
    circle:
    </p>

$$T \in Cir(O, r) \colon Ln(A \not\subset Cir(O, r), T) \bot Cir(O, r)$$

    <p>
    or:
    </p>

$$T \colon Ln(A, T) = p \bot Cir(O, r)$$

    <p>
    and so on.
    </p>
