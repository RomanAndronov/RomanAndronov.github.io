    <h1>g Objects</h1>

    <p>
    are geometric items such as a point, a straight line, a circle, an angle, a
    triangle, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Object Designations</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Points</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    are designated via single upper case English alphabet characters:
    </p>

$$A, B, C$$

    <p>
    which can be distinguished further via indexing with natural numbers:
    </p>

$$A_1, A_2, A_3$$

    <p>
    or primes: 
    </p>

$$A', B', C'$$


    <p>
    <br><strong>Line Segments</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    are designated either via a two-point notation:
    </p>

$$AB$$
   
    <p>
    in which letters stand for points which mark the boundaries of the line
    segment
    </p>
    
    <p>
    or via an arbitrary lower case English alphabet letter which may be further
    indexed with a natural number or primed:
    </p>

$$AB = c$$

    <p>
    which reads <dfn>"assign a name \(c\) to a line segment between the points
    \(A\) and \(B\)"</dfn>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Read <strong>Interpretation</strong> section about the rules of how exactly
    to interpret the meaning of the above assignment statement.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Straight Lines</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    are designated either via a functional notation:
    </p>

$$Ln(A, B)$$

    <p>
    which reads <dfn>"a straight line passing through the points \(A\) and
    \(B\)"</dfn>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    or via an arbitrary lower case English alphabet letter which may be further
    indexed with a natural number or primed:
    </p>

$$Ln(A, B) = p$$

    <p>
    which reads <dfn>"assign a name \(p\) to a straight line passing through the
    points \(A\) and \(B\)"</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Line Segments</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    are designated either via a functional notation:
    </p>

$$LnSeg(A, B)$$

    <p>
    which reads <dfn>"a segment of a straight line passing through the points
    \(A\) and \(B\)"</dfn>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    or via an arbitrary lower case English alphabet letter which may be further
    indexed with a natural number or primed:
    </p>

$$LnSeg(A, B) = q$$

    <p>
    which reads <dfn>"assign a name \(q\) to a segment of a straight line passing
    through the points \(A\) and \(B\)"</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Rays</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    are designated either via a functional notation:
    </p>

$$Ray(A, B)$$

    <p>
    which reads <dfn>"a ray passing through the point \(B\) with an origin at
    the point \(A\)"</dfn>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    or via an arbitrary lower case English alphabet letter which may be further
    indexed with a natural number or primed:
    </p>

$$Ray(A, B) = m$$

    <p>
    which reads <dfn>"assign a name \(m\) to a ray passing through the point \(B\)
    with origin at the point \(A\)"</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Circles</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    are designated either via a functional notation:
    </p>

$$Cir(O, r)$$

    <p>
    which reads <dfn>"a circle with a center at the point \(O\) and a radius
    \(r\)"</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    or via an arbitrary lower case English alphabet letter which may be further
    indexed with a natural number or primed:
    </p>

$$Cir(O, OA) = q$$

    <p>
    which reads <dfn>"assign a name \(q\) to a circle with a center at the point
    \(O\) and a radius \(OA\)"</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Though a circle is technically a plane figure, meaning a two-dimensional solid
    that encloses a certain amount of two-dimensional area, in the straight edge
    and compass constructions it is quite often taken to mean <dfn>"a
    circumference"</dfn>. The context in which the word <dfn>"circle"</dfn> is
    used should make it unambiguously clear what exactly is meant.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Circular Arcs</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    are designated either via a functional notation:
    </p>

$$Arc(O, AB)$$

    <p>
    which reads <dfn>"a circular arc between the points \(A\) and \(B\) of a
    circle with a center at the point \(O\)"</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    or via an arbitrary lower case English alphabet letter which may be further
    indexed with a natural number or primed:
    </p>

$$Arc(O, AB) = q$$

    <p>
    which reads <dfn>"assign a name \(q\) to a circular arc between the points
    \(A\) and \(B\) of the circle with a center at the point \(O\)"</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    We remark that by definition either \(OA\) or \(OB\) in designations above
    are equal to the radius of the circle in question and that out of two
    possible arcs <dfn>"the minor arc"</dfn> is meant by default.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Angles</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    are designated either via a symbolic notation:
    </p>

$$\angle ABC$$

    <p>
    which reads <dfn>"an angle with the vertex at the point \(B\) and legs on
    the straight lines \(BA\) and \(BC\)"</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    or via an arbitrary lower case Greek alphabet letter which may be indexed
    further with a natural number or primed:
    </p>

$$\angle ABC = \alpha$$

    <p>
    which reads <dfn>"assign a name \(\alpha\) to \(\angle ABC\)"</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    We remark that normally with a symbolic angle designation the name of the
    vertex of an angle is kept in the middle:
    </p>

$$\angle XYZ$$

    <p>
    tells us that the vertex of this angle is located at the point \(Y\) and
    that its legs pass through the points \(X\) and \(Z\).
    </p>

    <p>
    In rear cases when it is absolutely clear what is meant and no ambiguity
    can possibly arise it may be permissible to designate an angle via the
    name of a sole point - its vertex:
    </p>

$$\angle A$$
$$\angle B$$
$$\angle C$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Triangles</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    are designated symbolically via enumeration of their vertexes:
    </p>

$$\triangle ABC$$

    <p>
    for example, reads <dfn>"a triangle with vertexes located at the points \(A\),
    \(B\) and \(C\)"</dfn>.

    <p>
    <br><strong>Other n-gons</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    are designated verbally:
    </p>

    <p>
    - square \(ABCD\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - rectangle \(ABCD\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - pentagon \(ABCDE\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - 5-gon \(ABCDE\)
    </p>

    <p>
    and so on.
    </p>
