    <h1>g Statements</h1>

    <p>
    are line-oriented: one line is one statement.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Simple Statements</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    refer to only one wholesome object which may or may not consist of some
    number of atomic objects like points.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, the following statement:
    </p>

$$A$$

    <p>
    refers to a single point, \(A\).
    </p>

    <p>
    The statement:
    </p>

$$Ln(A, B)$$

    <p>
    refers to a straight line passing through two points, \(A\) and \(B\).
    </p>

    <p>
    The statement:
    </p>

$$Cir(O, r)$$

    <p>
    refers to a circle with a center located at the point \(O\) and a radius
    \(r\).
    </p>

    <p>
    The statement:
    </p>

$$\angle ABC$$

    <p>
    refers to an angle.
    </p>

    <p>
    The exact meaning of these statements is explained in
    <strong>Interpretation</strong> section.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Compound Statements</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    refer to two or more wholesome objects at a time. For example, the statement:
    </p>

$$A, B, C, D$$

    <p>
    refers to four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\) and \(D\).
    </p>

    <p>
    The statement:
    </p>

$$A \in Ln(B, C)$$

    <p>
    refers to two wholesome objects - a point and a straight line and means
    <dfn>"a point \(A\) is on a straight line passing through the points \(B\)
    and \(C\)"</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The statement:
    </p>

$$Ln(A, B) \cap Ln(C, D) = E$$

    <p>
    refers to three wholesome objects - two straight lines and a point and means
    <dfn>"a straight line passing through the points \(A\) and \(B\) and a straight
    line passing through the points \(C\) and \(D\) intersect at a point
    \(E\)"</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The statement:
    </p>

$$Cir(O_1, R) \cap Cir(O_2, r) = K, L$$

    <p>
    refers to four wholesome objects - two circles and two points and means
    <dfn>"a circle with a center at a point \(O_1\) and a radius \(R\) intersects
    with a circle with a center at a point \(O_2\) and a radius \(r\) at the
    points \(K\) and \(L\)"</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The statement:
    </p>

$$Ln(A, B) \bot Ln(C, D)$$

    <p>
    refers to two wholesome objects - two straight lines and means <dfn>"a
    straight line passing through the points \(A\) and \(B\) is perpendicular to
    a straight line passing through the points \(C\) and \(D\)"</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    And so on. Compound statements of arbitrary complexity can be built up as
    long as they make geometric sense.
