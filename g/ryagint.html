    <h1>g Statements Interpretation</h1>

    <p>
    Any recorded Euclidean construction is a collection of an arbitrary number
    of \(g\) statements. Any \(g\) statement is a collection of an arbitrary
    number of \(g\) objects and operators.
    </p>

    <p>
    If, while reading a \(g\) statement, we come across an object for the first
    time during the course of this particular construction then the statement
    means:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>take action</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    or
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>construct</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    the object in question.
    </p>

    <p>
    If, on the other hand, we come across a previously encountered object then
    the statement is a reference to an existing object.
    </p>

    <p>
    With the above rule in place let us investigate the exact meaning of the
    following sample \(g\) statement:
    </p>
   
$$A \in Ln(B, C)$$
   
    <p>
    Start deciphering the meaning of the above statement from its right-most
    object and move leftward:
    </p>

    <p>
    - if a point \(C\) does not exist in the current construction then pick an
    arbitrary point on a plane and name it \(C\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - if a point \(B\) does not exist in the current construction then pick a
    different from \(C\) arbitrary point on a plane and name it \(B\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - if a straight line passing through the points \(B\) and \(C\) does not exist
    at the current state of this construction then construct it
    </p>

    <p>
    - if a point \(A\) does not exist in the current construction then pick an
    arbitrary point different from \(B\) and \(C\) anywhere on the straight line
    passing through \(B\) and \(C\) and name that point \(A\)
    </p>

    <p>
    However, if all the objects in the above statement do exist in the current
    state of this construction then it simply states a geometric fact which is a
    result of the previously taken steps:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>because of so and so the point \(A\) is located on the straight line
    passing through the points \(B\) and \(C\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Alternatively, if all the objects in the above statement exist and this
    statement is a part of a bigger statement then its meaning is:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>because the point \(A\) is ... then the following must be true"</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    We observe that any compound statement can be decomposed into a collection
    of simple statements:
    </p>

$$B$$
$$C$$
$$Ln(B, C)$$
$$A \in Ln(B, C)$$

    <p>
    which are read verbatim as:
    </p>

    <p>
    - pick an arbitrary point on a plane and name it \(B\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - pick an arbitrary point on a plane other than \(B\) and name it \(C\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - construct a straight line passing through \(B\) and \(C\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - pick an arbitrary point on the straight line passing through \(B\) and \(C\)
    and name it \(A\)
    </p>

    <p>
    \(\blacksquare\)
    </p>
