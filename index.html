    Basic approaches are small, simple and generic descriptions of how a potential
    solution to a problem can be found. Find in this section a sampling of such
    approaches cast in a concrete problem-solution context that demonstrates the
    mechanics of the process
    </p>

    <strong>Software Construction</strong> section is a two-part tutorial
    exploring the incremental approach. The first part is an Arithmetic
    Expressions Calculator implementation based on the Shunting Yard algorithm
    with an interactive visualization applet. The second part is an adaptation
    of the same algorithm for Boolean Expressions Evaluator For Strings

    <strong>g</strong> is a small and simple language that I use to record the
    solutions to straight edge and compass construction problems
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p>
    <strong>Experiments</strong> section deals with my experiments with problem
    solving where I put my solution paths to various problems on public display

    In <strong>Triangle</strong> section I record the many ways in which this
    ubiquitous geometric object can be constructed
    </p>

    <strong>Inversion</strong> is a section dedicated to inversion of a real
    plane with respect to a circle. Inversion in a complex plane with respect
    to a circle and inversion with respect to a sphere are in the works

    <strong>Gear Clocks</strong> is a three-chapter book on the fundamentals of
    the inner workings of these beautiful objects. Find here a mix of a large
    amount of mathematics and physics along with practical instructions

      <strong>Kombinatorix Primordial</strong> is an introductory tutorial that
      gathers all the basic combinatorial counting principles in one place painting
      one, hopefully, coherent picture of the subject
      </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>
      <strong>GCD, the Euclidean Algorithm</strong> is a small tutorial that explains
      the inner workings of a classical way of computing a greatest common divisor of
      two integers
