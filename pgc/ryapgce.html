    </p>

    <p>
    In the introductory chapter we have modularized a mechanical gear clock into three major
    parts - a time intervals producer (pendulum), an intervals manager (escapement) and a time
    displayer (hands and face). We have covered the pendulum in a dedicated chapter and now we
    know how to calculate the pendulum's length for a chosen period \(T\). In this chapter we
    will investigate the inner workings of an escapement mechanism which is used to convert the
    back and forth swinging motion of a pendulum into a predictable circular motion of the gears.
    </p>

    <p>
    Over the years many different types of escapement mechanisms were invented. The purpose or
    area of application usually defined the concrete implementation. For example, a bell tower
    clock positioned at a considerable height above ground is subject to sudden wind gusts or
    snow accumulation which could be damaging to the mechanism if the appropriate steps are not
    taken. The need for a sturdy assembly for such situations was answered with
    <dfn>Gravity</dfn> and <dfn>Pin Wheel</dfn> escapements.
    </p>

    <p>
    In general an escapement mechanism carries two names - of its inventor, if known, and of
    its characteristic feature. For example, verge or crown-wheel, Hooke anchor or recoil,
    Graham deadbeat, Dennison gravity, Lepaute pin wheel, Brocot pin pallet, Mudge gravity,
    Grimthorpe three-legged gravity, Riefler, Harrison grasshopper, Bloxham and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    There are two reasons why we will examine the inner workings of the <dfn>Deadbeat</dfn>
    or <dfn>Graham Escapement</dfn> invented as the name implies by the British watchmaker
    George Graham (1673-1751) in 1715. Time being on our side the deadbeat escapement has been
    historically proven to produce accurate results. And it does not require expensive
    industrial machinery to manufacture - it is well within our reach, after some practice, to
    have it ticking within couple of hours. In addition George Graham was one of those simply
    decent human beings whose technical talents were matched by an equal amount of generosity
    - he refused to patent his invention reasoning that other clock makers should also be able
    to use it free of charge.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Major Parts</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    As a first much simplified cut the two major parts of most of popular escapements are
    an <dfn>Anchor</dfn> or a <dfn>Fork</dfn> and an <dfn>Escape Wheel</dfn>. Let us examine
    these parts as they are implemented in the deadbeat escapement.
    </p>

    <p>
    A fork and a pendulum are coaxal. The net affect of such an arrangement is that the fork
    and the pendulum swing in unison. It further means that if a pendulum reaches its extreme
    position - so does the fork. Though most escapement forks are called forks they are actually
    two-tooth spur gears in disguise. As such they must mesh with the escape wheel to operate
    properly. I have used the OpenSCAD software to create the following drawing. It is based
    on the 2-D geometric constructions of the escape wheel and the fork at the end of this
    chapter. If you want to understand, modify and improve the OpenSCAD program it is best to
    work through the 2-D steps first:

    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc04.png" class="center">

    <p>
    The two major parts of a fork are a <dfn>Crutch</dfn> or an <dfn>Arm</dfn> and a
    <dfn>Pallet</dfn>. A fork has two arms and two pallets - one per arm. The angle under
    which the pallets are seen from the center of the escape wheel depends on a variable
    set by the author - the number of teeth of the escape wheel embraced or hugged by the
    fork. The more teeth are embraced - the larger the angle and conversely.
    </p>

    <p>
    The escape wheel can rotate in either of two directions - clockwise or counterclockwise,
    the former by far being the most popular one. If the escape wheel rotates clockwise, as
    depicted in the drawing below, then the pallet on the left is called an <dfn>Entry
    Pallet</dfn>, \(P_n\), while the pallet on the right is called an <dfn>Exit Pallet</dfn>,
    \(P_x\). If the escape wheel rotates counterclockwise, a less popular but nonetheless
    an implementable choice, then the pallet on the right would be an Entry Pallet while the
    pallet on the left would be an Exit Pallet with the remaining definitions that follow
    reversed accordingly. The direction of rotation of the escape wheel must be decided on
    ahead of time because it affects the fork's final configuration which is not symmetrical
    (to avoid the clutter the pendulum is not shown):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc05.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Each pallet has two special surfaces or, more commonly, simply <dfn>Faces</dfn>. One
    face is called <dfn>Dead</dfn>, or <dfn>Stopping</dfn>, or <dfn>Locking</dfn> or
    <dfn>Resting Face</dfn>, the other is called an <dfn>Impulse Face</dfn>. The stopping
    face is a portion of a right circular cylinder whose axis of rotation coincides with the
    axis of the fork. The impulse face is a plane formed by the intersection of the above
    (stopping) cylinder with another plane running parallel to the fork's or cylinder's axis
    of rotation.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this arrangement the stopping face \(S_n\) of the <dfn>entry</dfn> pallet is located
    on its <dfn>outer</dfn> side while the stopping face \(S_x\) of the <dfn>exit</dfn>
    pallet is located on its <dfn>inner</dfn> side. As such the pallets are not entirely
    symmetrical. The absence of symmetry is explained by the fact that two different types
    of motion are forced to interact with each other - circular, in one direction only, of
    the escape wheel and oscillating, back and forth, of the fork.
    </p>

    <p>
    The intersection of the stopping and impulse faces forms a <dfn>Stop</dfn>, or
    <dfn>Lock</dfn>, or <dfn>Rest</dfn> or <dfn>Dead Corner</dfn>. The intersection of the
    impulse face with the face opposite to the stopping face forms the <dfn>Discharge
    Corner</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    From the above definitions of the stopping and impulse faces it follows that it is
    possible to make either of them equidistant from the center of the fork. As such there
    are two major design variations of the fork - when the <dfn>impulse</dfn> faces are
    equidistant from the axis of the fork or when the <dfn>stopping</dfn> faces are
    equidistant from the axis of the fork.
    </p>

    <p>
    If the <dfn>impulse</dfn> faces are equidistant from the axis of the fork then its arms
    have <dfn>equal</dfn> lengths while if the <dfn>stopping</dfn> faces are equidistant
    from the center of the fork then its arms have <dfn>different</dfn> lengths. The drawing
    above depicts a fork with the equidistant impulse faces. Historically there was much
    debate about which arrangement is better but by now it has been established that there
    is no major difference between the two performance wise so pick the most technologically
    convenient one. I will cover the construction of both types of forks.
    </p>

    <p>
    Unlike the fork the escape wheel is not attached to the pendulum's axis but rather sits
    on a separate axis of its own. Normally the escape wheel is set in motion with a weight
    attached to it with a string. As gravity pulls the weight down the weight pulls on the
    string which in turn pulls on and spins the wheel. After the weight reaches the floor it
    stops pulling on the escape wheel which eventually comes to a complete stop. Rewind the
    string to set the escape wheel in motion again:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc06.png" class="center">

    <p>
    <br><strong>Cycle of Operation</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    To better understand the cycle of operation of an escapement mechanism let us conduct
    the following thought experiment. Imagine a fork swinging back and forth by itself
    in one location and an escape wheel spinning by itself in a different location so that
    the two are not in contact. Observe that we have two independent motions occurring
    simultaneously. Nothing particularly interesting is happening. Now let us bring the
    swinging fork and the spinning wheel closer and closer together until they come into
    contact in the same plane as spur gears should, engage and start a two-way interaction
    with each other. The way to determine the exact distance between the centers of the
    escape wheel and the fork will be explained below.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now on the one hand, during the moments of their physical contact, the fork puts an end
    to the escape gear's freewheeling by forcing it to turn at a specific rate which we can
    calculate ahead of time. On the other hand, the escape wheel passes the potential energy
    of the attached weight on to the fork in the form of a gentle nudge. The fork passes
    that energy on to the axis which in turn passes it on to the pendulum thus keeping it
    swinging at a constant rate.
    </p>

    <p>
    The upcoming terminology may sound very confusing for a novice because its use is
    overloaded - the same words are used to describe <dfn>a process</dfn> or <dfn>an
    event</dfn> - as verbs and define <dfn>magnitudes</dfn> - as nouns. In particular this
    applies to <dfn>Lock</dfn>, <dfn>Lift</dfn> and <dfn>Drop</dfn>. Not only that - the
    word <dfn>drop</dfn> is used in two different contexts.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before we deep dive into more details it should be duly noted that from this point
    onward, in various procedures, steps and definitions I will explicitly avoid specifying
    any measurements in <dfn>linear</dfn> magnitudes. For these procedures, steps and
    definitions to be truly generic they must be framed in the independent terms -
    <dfn>angular</dfn> in this case. The gears of <dfn>any physical size</dfn> can then be
    drawn - small, medium or large and anything in between.
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc07.png" class="center">

    <p>
    In the series of sketches above the escape wheel always runs clockwise and so are the
    progressive positions of the single depicted tooth. Let us start at the leftmost sketch
    when the tip \(T\) of the wheel's tooth just kissed the entry pallet \(P_n\) on the
    (outer) stopping face \(S_n\). The reason this surface is called <dfn>stopping</dfn> is
    because for a brief moment the escape wheel stops rotating since \(S_n\) is in its way.
    </p>

    <p>
    The exact <dfn>manner</dfn> in which the wheel stops is very important - it does so
    without any recoil which the earlier <dfn>anchor</dfn> design suffered from. The
    absence of recoil during the fork-wheel interaction is one of the key features of
    Graham's invention. Do keep in mind that even though the <dfn>wheel</dfn> stops - the
    <dfn>pendulum</dfn> does not as it <dfn>and the pallet of the fork</dfn> keep tracing
    out circular paths.
    </p>

    <p>
    As <dfn>a process</dfn> or as <dfn>an event</dfn> the above kissing moment, which
    occurs very close to the pendulum's right extreme point, is called a <dfn>Lock</dfn>.
    By analogy with the name of the responsible surface we might as well call it
    <dfn>Stop</dfn>, <dfn>Rest</dfn> or <dfn>Death</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    As a purely geometric idea a point or an edge are very convenient notions but in
    practice the tip of the tooth of the escape wheel should not come into contact with the
    stopping face \(S_n\) dead on a point or an edge. It should also not land on the impulse
    face either - that as is easy to imagine would be really bad. So in practice, for a safe
    mechanism operation, we want the tip of the tooth to land somewhere above the lock
    <dfn>corner</dfn> \(C_n\) at a point we can call a <dfn>Lock Point</dfn> \(L_n\). As
    <dfn>a magnitude</dfn> then a Lock is the angle between \(C_n\) and \(L_n\) measured
    along the circumference of the stopping surface the center of which is located at \(F\).
    In the drawing below I exaggerated that angle greatly for demonstration purposes. In
    practice it is usually about \(1^{\circ}\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc08.png" class="center">

    <p>
    After the pendulum reaches its right extreme point and flips its swing from
    counterclockwise to clockwise the entry pallet's (outer) stopping face \(S_n\) glides
    upwards for a while, along the stationary tip \(T\), tracing a circular arc, until
    the entry pallet's lock corner \(C_n\) comes into contact with \(T\). Note that in
    reality \(C_n\) is an edge - an intersection of a right circular cylinder with a plane
    running parallel to the cylinder's axis of rotation.
    </p>

    <p>
    At that moment the wheel resumes its clockwise rotation as nothing stands in its way.
    The tip \(T\) now kisses the impulse face of the entry pallet \(I_n\), see the second
    sketch above. As <dfn>a process</dfn> it is called a <dfn>Lift</dfn>. During that
    process as \(T\) runs from a lock to a discharge corner, from \(C_n\) to \(D_n\), the
    fork sweeps a certain angle. A Lift as <dfn>a magnitude</dfn> is that angle:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc09.png" class="center">

    <p>
    It is during that lift, as both the wheel, \(T\), and the fork, \(P_n\), run clockwise,
    the potential energy is transferred <dfn>from</dfn> the wheel <dfn>to</dfn> the pallet
    and hence to the pendulum. That is why \(I_n\) is called an <dfn>impulse</dfn> face. To
    reiterate, the energy is transferred from the wheel to the pallet on the pallet's
    upswing, against gravity. When \(T\) reaches \(D_n\), the discharge corner, it breaks
    its contact with the fork. The arithmetic sum of the above two angles, the lock and the
    lift (or actual lift) is called a <dfn>Total Lift</dfn> or an <dfn>Escape Angle</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    At this point the escape wheel runs free but only for a short while as it is soon stopped
    by the opposite, exit, pallet because the entry pallet swung almost all the way up
    corresponding to the event of the pendulum almost reaching its left extreme point. This
    is the exact moment captured in the last sketch above - the angle swept by the escape
    wheel while running free of contact with either pallet. As <dfn>a process</dfn> this
    freewheeling is called a <dfn>Drop</dfn>. It is bracketed by two events - \(T\) breaking
    contact with the entry pallet and the escape wheel as a whole being stopped completely as
    its different tooth comes into contact with the exit pallet.
    </p>

    <p>
    During this process the escape wheel or simply \(T\) sweeps a certain angle. A Drop as
    <dfn>a magnitude</dfn> is that angle - it is highlighted with a different color in the
    sketch.
    </p>

    <p>
    The drop as <dfn>a process</dfn> occurs once per beat or twice per pendulum's period of
    oscillation. Once when one tooth is about to kiss the exit pallet while another tooth
    turns away from the discharge corner of the entry pallet and another time when one tooth
    is about to kiss the entry pallet while another tooth turns away from the discharge
    corner of the exit pallet.
    </p>

    <p>
    After the drop as a process is over the above tooth-pallet interaction scenario plays
    out again. The wheel's tooth \(T\) kisses the exit pallet's (inner) stopping face
    \(S_x\), the lock. The pendulum's swing flips from clockwise to counterclockwise. The
    lock corner \(C_x\) glides into contact with \(T\) which resumes its clockwise run giving
    \(I_x\) a gentle nudge upwards against gravity, the lift. Note that during this love
    affair the fork runs counterclockwise while \(T\) runs clockwise until they part their
    ways. The wheel revolves free for a short while, the drop, but is soon trapped by the
    entry pallet and the whole process repeats.
    </p>

    <p>
    To sum up the above cycle at the intuitive, gut level this dynamic duo goes through lock,
    lift and drop in a potentially never ending succession. The lock and the drop as the
    magnitudes should be as small as technologically possible.
    </p>

    <p>
    Keep in mind that not only the stopping faces of the entry and exit pallets are situated
    differently but the orientation of the impulse faces is different as well. When the
    pendulum (and the fork) is at rest the impulse face of the entry pallet is closer to a
    horizontal while the impulse face of the exit pallet is closer to a vertical.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Purpose</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Now that we know <dfn>how</dfn> the escapement mechanism works let us investigate
    <dfn>why</dfn> is it needed, what is its purpose. Since we already have a pendulum
    that swings at a known rate, we wish to somehow exploit that regularity by transforming
    its choppiness into continuousness. That is where the escapement mechanism comes in.
    </p>

    <p>
    It actually serves two purposes - to <dfn>convert</dfn> and to <dfn>maintain</dfn>.
    As a pure time intervals manager the escapement is needed to convert the back and
    forth motion of a pendulum into a controlled circular motion of the gears. To put it
    even simpler - escapement translates so many swings into that many rotations. The
    swings are of the pendulum, the rotations are of the gears.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us break down the motion of a pendulum in a more atomic way and introduce a formal
    concept of a <dfn>Swing</dfn> or a <dfn>Beat</dfn>. Let us further agree that such a
    beat is <dfn>an event</dfn> of a pendulum reaching one of its extreme points after
    departing from the opposite extreme point. Using the drawing from the Pendulum chapter
    a beat corresponds to our pendulum reaching the point \(B\) after departing from the
    point \(A\). To make it perfectly clear a beat is not a <dfn>time</dfn> but an
    <dfn>event</dfn> which occurs after some amount of time goes by.
    </p>

    <p>
    With the above definition in place we can capture a unique characteristic of any
    pendulum numerically via its rate or frequency - in the number of beats per unit of time.
    One convenient unit of time is one minute or \(60\) seconds. Since in time one beat
    corresponds to half the period, the number of beats per minute \(B_m\) then is:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
B_m = \frac {60}{\frac {T}{2}} = \frac {120}{T}
\end{equation}$$
 
    <p>
    where \(T\) is given in seconds. Our \(2\)-second pendulum then makes \(60\) beats per
    minute, for example.
    </p>

    <p>
    Using the above terms we can say that the escapement mechanism converts a known number
    of pendulum's beats per minute \(B_m\) into a known number of full revolutions \(R_m\)
    of a single gear per minute. If we call this special (conversion) gear an <dfn>Escape
    Wheel</dfn> and to that wheel we connect one or more gears the last one of which
    rotates at the exact rate of one full revolution per minute then we can attach a hand
    to that wheel which gives us a way to tell seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
    If to the above second gear we connect one or more gears the last one of which rotates
    at the exact rate of one full revolution per hour (or \(60\) times slower) and to that
    wheel we attach a hand then we have a way to tell minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, if to the above minute gear we connect one or more gears the last one of which
    rotates at the exact rate of one full revolution in \(12\) hours (or \(12\) times slower)
    and to that wheel we attach a hand then we have a way to tell hours, the clock is
    complete and we can ... sell it. Just kidding.
    </p>

    <p>
    Our <dfn>idealized</dfn> pendulum may swing forever but a <dfn>real</dfn> one of course
    will not. The friction and the air resistance will eat away the initial energy given to
    the pendulum by our muscle power. If left unattended such a pendulum will not swing at a
    constant rate - it will slow down over time until it stops completely.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition to a conversion role the escapement mechanism is used to address this
    gradual slow down phenomena by taking on an extra role of a constant rate of swings
    maintainer. We have covered the exact way this is done in the cycle of operation section
    above. The energy transfer from the wheel to the fork in the form of gentle pushes or
    nudges must be carefully orchestrated. These nudges can not be haphazard and frivolous
    but rather must be doled out in precise and delicate dosages - not too large as they will
    disrupt the workings of the entire mechanism and not too small as they will have no
    meaningful effect. Put it another way, the escapement mechanism releases the potential
    energy of the weight or the elastic potential energy of a spring in small chunks (quanta)
    over a prolonged period of time. The devil here is in the construction details and that
    is what we will look at next.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>The Deadbeat Escape Wheel</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    The deadbeat escape wheel is a special \(n\)-tooth spur gear that must mesh with another
    special two-tooth spur gear - a fork. If at this point you are not familiar with gears
    you should acquire some basic knowledge about them out of band since this knowledge will
    be much needed. I list a few gear-related books at the end of the Hands chapter but the
    crash course on gears as they relate to us is this.
    </p>

    <p>
    Conceptually gears are levers. Practically they can be classified roughly by the relative
    position of their axes in space - parallel, intersecting, neither. Physically gears are
    implemented based on surfaces capable of rolling without slipping. The most popular
    surfaces are right cylinders, truncated cones and hyperboloids, circular or elliptic.
    If two engaged gears rotate smoothly without blocking and vibration it is said that they
    <dfn>mesh</dfn>. Two or more gears connected for a purpose are called a <dfn>Gear
    Train</dfn>. The purpose usually is to convert a known input into a desired output.
    </p>

    <p>
    A gear to which an input or power is applied directly is called a <dfn>Driving</dfn>
    or an <dfn>Input Gear</dfn> and a gear affected by it is called a <dfn>Driven</dfn> or
    a <dfn>Follower</dfn> or an <dfn>Output Gear</dfn>. A <dfn>Gear Ratio</dfn> \(r_{io}\)
    of two gears is:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
r_{io} = \frac {\omega_i}{\omega_o} = \frac {N_o}{N_i}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    where \(\omega\) designates an angular velocity and \(N\) designates a tooth count of
    the gears. If in a gear train we carve out a path from the input gear to the gear of
    interest, possibly the last one, and calculate the gear ratio of all the pairs in
    between then by taking the product of all these ratios we will arrive at the gear ratio
    of an aggregate - the whole or part of a train. To calculate the gear ratio of a current
    pair in the above set make the output gear of the previous pair an input gear for the
    current one. We will look at the gear trains in a bit more detail in the Hands chapter.
    </p>

    <p>
    In clock making we are interested in a special type of gears that mesh in the same plane,
    have parallel axes and straight teeth. Such gears are called <dfn>Spur Gears</dfn>. They
    are distinguished further by the shape of their teeth or by a particular type of a plane
    curve used to construct them. A <dfn>Cycloid</dfn> was an early choice but later on an
    <dfn>Involute of a Circle</dfn> became very popular as its use lead to gears that
    performed better under high speeds and heavy loads. An involute of a circle is a plane
    curve traced by a point at the end of a taut string as it unwinds off of or winds around
    the circumference of a stationary circle. Clock gear trains, however, are unlike most of
    their industrial cousins. They turn very slowly under very light loads. As such it is
    perfectly fine to use either cycloidal or involute tooth profiles in your projects.
    </p>

    <p>
    The deadbeat escape wheel, as I mentioned before, is a special animal as its teeth can
    be made triangular in shape and in theory arbitrary in number. In practice, however,
    certain tooth counts have an advantage over the others. To see why let us task ourselves
    with a requirement of designing a clock with the smallest number of gears practically
    possible. The question then is - how many teeth must the escape wheel have for it to make
    one full revolution in exactly one minute? If we find the answer to that question then we
    can attach a second hand to the escape wheel directly and use it to drive the minute and
    hour gears.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since the escapement mechanism is designed in such a way that each extremity of the fork
    engages one tooth of the escape wheel once per period of oscillation then we can equate
    the number of such engagements to the number of teeth of the escape wheel \(N_m\) where
    sub index \(m\) designates the chosen time interval of one minute or \(60\) seconds. It
    follows then that if one engagement occurs in \(T\) seconds then \(N_m\) engagements
    occur in a given time interval or \(60\) seconds:
    </p>

$$N_m \times T = 60$$
$$\begin{equation}
N_m = \frac {60}{T}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Our \(2\)-second pendulum then should have a \(30\)-tooth escape wheel which will make
    one full revolution in one minute. Keeping the one full revolution per minute requirement
    the \(1\)-second pendulum should have a \(60\)-tooth escape wheel, the \(4\)-second
    pendulum should have a \(15\)-tooth wheel and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now that we have a connection between \(T\) and \(N_m\) instead of deciding on the value
    of \(T\) we may decide on the value of \(N_m\). If we solve (3) for \(T\) and substitute
    it into the length of pendulum's rod formula we can dispense with the period altogether
    and calculate \(l\) as a function of \(N_m\):
    </p>

$$T(N_m) = \frac {60}{N_m}$$
$$l(N_m) = \frac {g}{4\pi^2}\frac{T^2}{S^2} = \frac {g}{4\pi^2}\frac{3600}{N_m^2S^2}$$
$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{l(N_m) = \frac {900g}{(\pi N_m S)^2}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    For example, if we take \(S = 1\) and wish to have a \(40\)-tooth escape wheel then a
    rough estimate for \(l\) for NYC, NY, is \(55.87\) centimeters. For a \(50\)-tooth wheel
    we get roughly \(35.76\) centimeters and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    As we can see we can drive the design of our clock by a number of parameters. We can
    fix \(T\) to obtain \(N_m\) and \(l\), we can fix \(N_m\) to obtain \(l\) and \(T\) or
    we can fix \(T\) to obtain \(l\) and pick an arbitrary number of teeth for the escape
    wheel, \(N\), without imposing the one full revolution per minute requirement on it.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the latter case let us say we want a \(50\)-tooth escape wheel for a \(2\)-second
    pendulum. In this case the wheel will make one full revolution every \(50 \times 2 =
    100\) seconds. As an option, since we, the designers, are in control, we may choose to
    not have the second hand at all. Since there are \(3600\) seconds in one hour, our
    \(50\)-tooth escape wheel will make \(3600 \div 100 = 36\) full revolutions.
    Consequently, to the above \(50\)-tooth escape wheel we attach a \(36:1\) gear train
    the last gear of which will make one full revolution in exactly one hour, we attach
    the minute hand to that gear and proceed on to the hour hand as usual.
    </p>

    <p>
    Keep in mind that whether we impose the one full revolution per minute requirement on the
    escape wheel or not it still has to interact with the fork. As such between two
    consecutive engagements <dfn>with the same pallet</dfn>, entry or exit, or per period
    of oscillation the escape wheel will turn:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\theta_T = \frac {360^{\circ}}{N}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    degrees where \(N\) is the escape wheel's tooth count. However, between two consecutive
    engagements <dfn>with the opposite pallets</dfn>, first entry and then exit, or per
    beat the escape wheel will turn half of the above value:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\theta_b = \frac {\theta_T}{2} = \frac {180^{\circ}}{N}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    It follows then that if we attach a second hand directly to the escape wheel then per
    beat that hand will sweep \(\theta_b\) degrees. To translate that angular measure into
    the corresponding number of seconds swept by the second hand per beat we need to divide
    \(\theta_b\) by \(6\) degrees - the angular distance between the one-second/one-minute
    gradation marks on a traditional clock face:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
sec_b = \frac {\theta_b}{6^{\circ}} = \frac {30}{N}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    It should be clear now why some tooth counts for an escape wheel are more advantageous
    than the others. For our \(2\)-second pendulum the \(30\)-tooth escape wheel will turn
    \(6\) degrees per beat making the second hand attached to it sweep exactly one-second
    intervals - a perfect fit as long as we align the clock face with gradations on it
    properly. For the upcoming drawing procedure, however, it does not really matter exactly
    <dfn>how</dfn> you came up with the escape wheel's tooth count. You just have to settle
    on <dfn>a number</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before we move on to the drawing steps we will need to get acquainted with a small
    amount of basic terminology.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Wheel Anatomy</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Since all our gears are spur gears, when I say <dfn>"a gear"</dfn> it should be taken
    to mean <dfn>"a spur gear"</dfn> unless otherwise noted. A spur gear is based on a 
    right circular cylinder or simply cylinder from now on. If we cut such a cylinder with
    a plane perpendicular to the cylinder's axis of rotation a circular surface will result.
    This surface is called a <dfn>Face</dfn> of a gear. The edges of the gear's teeth are
    straight lines that run parallel to the cylinder's axis of rotation and as such they are
    perpendicular to the gear's face. That is what is meant when we say that the teeth of a
    spur gear are <dfn>straight</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The largest circle of a gear's face is called an <dfn>Outer</dfn> or an
    <dfn>Addendum</dfn> or a <dfn>Tip Circle</dfn>. Its radius is a linear distance from the
    center of a gear to the outer tips of its teeth. Since we are dealing with a circle,
    by definition all the outer tips of all the teeth are equidistant from the center of the
    gear:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc10.png" class="center">

    <p>
    On the same face of a gear there is a circle on the circumference of which the roots of the
    gear's teeth sit. That circle is called a <dfn>Root</dfn> or a <dfn>Dedendum Circle</dfn>.
    The radius of a root circle is also a linear measure. The difference between the radii of
    the outer and root circles which determines a linear height of the gear's teeth is
    called a <dfn>Whole Depth</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Tooth Anatomy</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    It is possible to use a number of different tooth profiles for a deadbeat escape wheel.
    We will settle on a triangular profile - a shape trapped between two straight lines -
    the <dfn>Leading Line</dfn> and the <dfn>Trailing Line</dfn>. The tip of a tooth is
    located on the circumference of the tip circle. The root of a tooth is located on the
    circumference of the root circle. A small portion of the leading line close to the tip
    of a tooth comes into a direct contact with the pallets. No points on the trailing line
    come into contact with the pallets.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us call the angle between the tip radius and the trailing line the <dfn>Trailing
    Angle</dfn> \(\theta_t\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc11.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Since in practice the very tip of a tooth is not exactly sharp, let us call the angle
    under which the two tooth tip edges are seen from the center of the gear the
    <dfn>Central Angle</dfn> \(\theta_c\). In the drawing below the magnitude of the central
    angle is exaggerated greatly for demonstration purposes. In practice it is about
    \(0.5^{\circ}\). Let us further agree that the two corresponding points (edges) on the
    circumference of the tip circle are the <dfn>Trailing Edge</dfn> and the <dfn>Leading
    Edge</dfn>:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc12.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Lastly, we will undercut our teeth by an arbitrary angle which the leading line forms
    with the tip radius of a gear. Let us call that angle the <dfn>Leading Angle</dfn>
    \(\theta_l\). The purpose of the undercutting is to make the surface area of contact
    between the leading edge of a tooth and a pallet smaller which in turn will make the
    friction between the two smaller. The undercutting also makes the teeth of the escape
    wheel <dfn>lean in the direction of rotation</dfn>:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc13.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Using the triangles involved we can work out the magnitude of the <dfn>Included
    Angle</dfn> of a tooth \(\theta_i\) - the angle between the trailing and leading
    lines:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/pgc14.png" class="center">

$$\theta_i + (180^{\circ} - \theta_t) + (\theta_c + \theta_l) = 180^{\circ}$$
$$\theta_i = \theta_t - \theta_c - \theta_l$$

    <p>
    Let us also agree to call the central angle under which two like edges of two adjacent
    teeth are seen from the center of the escape wheel the <dfn>Angular Pitch</dfn> \(ap\):
    </p>

<img src="imgs/pgc15.png" class="center">

    <p>
    The Angular Pitch is derived by dividing \(360^{\circ}\) by the number of teeth of the
    escape wheel.
    </p>

    <p>
    With the above definitions in place the tooth, the wheel and the fork construction
    procedures become transparent.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>To Draw the Deadbeat Escape Wheel</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In the long run, in a steady state of making clocks it is very likely that you will be
    using software to draw the gears. However, it will not hurt to know how to do it manually
    yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before drawing a deadbeat escape wheel choose:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) Direction of rotation<br>
    2) Tooth count \(N\)<br>
    3) Tip radius \(R_t\)<br>
    4) Root radius \(R_r\)<br>
    5) Tooth Trailing Angle \(\theta_t\)<br>
    6) Tooth Central Angle \(\theta_c\)<br>
    7) Tooth Leading Angle \(\theta_l\)<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    For the following demonstration the choices are:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) Direction of rotation: clockwise<br>
    2) Tooth count \(N = 30\)<br>
    3) Tip radius \(R_t\)<br>
    4) Root radius \(R_r = 0.75 \times R_t\)<br>
    5) Tooth Trailing Angle \(\theta_t = 18.5^{\circ}\)<br>
    6) Tooth Central Angle \(\theta_c = 0.5^{\circ}\)<br>
    7) Tooth Leading Angle \(\theta_l = 6^{\circ}\)<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    It follows then that:
    </p>

$$\theta_i = 18.5^{\circ} - 0.5^{\circ} - 6^{\circ} = 12^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    and:
    </p>

$$ap = 360^{\circ} \div N = 12^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    Procedure:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) Draw a straight line of centers \(c\). The centers of the escape wheel and the fork
    will be on it, pick a convenient orientation.
    </p>

    <p>
    2) With the center \(W\) on \(c\) and the radius \(R_t\) draw the tip circle \(t\).
    </p>

    <p>
    3) With the center at \(W\) and the radius \(R_r\) draw the root circle \(r\).
    </p>

    <p>
    4) Let \(A\) be one of the intersections points of \(c\) and \(t\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc16.png" class="center">

    <p>
    5) Construct one tooth starting with the Trailing Angle. With \(W\) as a leg point
    and \(A\) as a vertex draw the Trailing Angle \(\theta_t\) in the chosen direction,
    clockwise in this case. Let \(D\) be the intersection of the remaining side \(\tau\)
    of \(\theta_t\) with the root circle \(r\) so that \(\theta_t = \angle WAD\).
    </p>

    <p>
    6) With \(A\) as a leg point and \(W\) as a vertex draw the Central Angle \(\theta_c\)
    in the chosen direction, clockwise in this case. Let \(B\) be the intersection of the
    remaining side \(\sigma\) of \(\theta_c\) with the tip circle \(t\) so that \(\theta_c
    = \angle AWB\).
    </p>

    <p>
    7) With \(W\) as a leg point and \(B\) as a vertex draw the Leading Angle \(\theta_l\)
    in the chosen direction, clockwise in this case. Let \(C\) be the intersection of the
    remaining side \(\lambda\) of \(\theta_l\) with the root circle \(r\) so that
    \(\theta_l = \angle WBC\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc17.png" class="center">

    <p>
    At this point the shape \(ABCD\) delineates one tooth. \(DA\) is the trailing line (plane),
    \(A\) is the trailing edge, \(B\) is the leading edge, \(BC\) is the leading line (plane)
    and \(DC\) is the root:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc18.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Using your software's features repeat the steps 4-7 the remaining \(N - 1\) times rotating
    the reference straight line \(c\) by the magnitude of the Angular Pitch \(ap\) about the
    center of the escape wheel \(W\) each time if needed. Most types of graphing software have
    a feature called <dfn>Rotate</dfn>. You can either rotate the whole tooth or if your
    software can not do that then rotate each point separately.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once all the teeth are in place make sure that you have marked the center of the escape
    wheel clearly. Draw a small circle around the center of the wheel to represent the
    opening for its shaft:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc19.png" class="center">

    <p>
    This is where the science mostly ends and the art mostly begins. Draw the spokes of the
    wheel making them regular in shape or ornamental - your imagination is the only limit at
    this point. Keep in mind that the escape wheel should possess two conflicting qualities.
    On the one hand, it should be made as light as possible - hollow it out a lot and on the
    other hand, the wheel and its teeth should be sturdy enough to withstand the many many
    happy hours of operation. In other words balance the light and hollow against the sturdy
    and true.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>To Draw The Deadbeat Fork</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    The exact location of the center of the fork depends on the size and the tooth count of
    the escape wheel it will mesh with. As such - draw the escape wheel first or at least
    highlight the locations of some number of needed teeth. The procedure to do so is
    described above.
    </p>

    <p>
    Next, before drawing the fork choose:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) The number of teeth of the escape wheel the fork will span, \(N_s\)<br>
    2) The lock angle, \(\theta_l\)<br>
    3) The lift angle, \(\theta_f\)<br>
    4) The drop angle, \(\theta_d\) It should include the magnitude of the Central
        Angle of a tooth \(\theta_c\) chosen in the previous procedure.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    For the following demonstration the choices are:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) \(N_s = 7.5\)<br>
    2) \(\theta_l = 1^{\circ}\)<br>
    3) \(\theta_f = 2^{\circ}\)<br>
    4) \(\theta_d = 1^{\circ} = \theta_c + 0.5^{\circ}\)<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Procedure:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) Locate the center of the fork.
    </p>

    <p>
    Multiply \(N_s\) by the Angular Pitch of the escape wheel \(ap\) to obtain the
    <dfn>Span Angle</dfn> of the fork \(\theta_s\). In our case we get \(\theta_s = 7.5
    \times 12^{\circ} = 90^{\circ}\) or in general:
    </p>

$$\theta_s = N_s \times \frac {360^{\circ}}{N}$$

    <p>
    2) Divide the Span Angle \(\theta_s\) in half.
    </p>

    <p>
    With \(W\) as a vertex and \(A\) as a leg point construct each half of \(\theta_s\)
    on either side of the line of centers \(c\) - one half clockwise and the other half
    counterclockwise. In our case each half is \(45^{\circ}\). Let \(T_n\) and \(T_x\)
    be the intersections of the remaining sides \(s_n\) and \(s_x\) of the half-angles
    with the tip circle \(t\).
    </p>

    <p>
    3) Construct a tangent \(\tau_n\) to \(t\) through \(T_n\).
    </p>

    <p>
    4) Construct a tangent \(\tau_x\) to \(t\) through \(T_x\).
    </p>

    <p>
    5) The intersection point of \(\tau_n\) and \(\tau_x\) with the line of centers \(c\)
    locates the center of the fork \(F\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc20.png" class="center">

    <p>
    From this it follows that analytically the distance between the centers of the escape
    wheel and the fork \(WF\) and the distances \(FT_n\) and \(FT_x\) are:
    </p>

$$WF = \frac {R_t}{\cos\Big(\pi \frac {N_S}{N}\Big)}$$
$$FT_n = FT_x = R_t\tan\Big(\pi \frac {N_S}{N}\Big)$$

    <p>
    6) Find the radial width of the fork's pallets.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is where the procedures for two different types of forks diverge. Let us first
    construct a fork with the equidistant impulse faces. Since we have two pallets each of
    which invades the space between two adjacent teeth, it follows that the single intertooth
    space should be split equally between each pallet and in addition it should have some
    wiggle room - the drop which includes the central angle of a tooth or its thickness
    along the circumference of the tip circle. Without the drop the pallets would fill the
    space between the teeth too tight and the whole mechanism would likely malfunction.
    </p>

    <p>
    From the Cycle of Operation section we remember that the drop as a process occurs once
    per beat or twice per pendulum's period of oscillation. Therefore divide the Angular
    Pitch of the escape wheel \(ap\) in half: \(12^{\circ} \div 2 = 6^{\circ}\). And then
    subtract the magnitude of the drop angle from that half to find the radial width angle
    \(\theta_w\) of both pallets under which they are seen from the center of the escape
    wheel: \(\theta_w = 6^{\circ} - 1^{\circ} = 5^{\circ}\) or in general:
    </p>

$$\theta_w = \frac {360^{\circ}}{2N} - \theta_d$$

    <p>
    Since we are drawing a fork with the impulse faces equidistant from its center \(F\),
    the point \(T_n\) divides the radial width of both pallets exactly in half. Therefore
    \(\theta_w\) must be split equally between each half: divide \(\theta_w\) by \(2\) and
    construct each half-anlge on each side of the straight line \(s_n\) (\(WT_n\)) using
    \(T_n\) as a leg point and \(W\) as a vertex. In our case we get the \(2.5^{\circ}\)
    angles:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/pgc21.png" class="center">

    <p>
    7) Let \(L_n\) and \(H_n\) be the intersections of the remaining sides \(h_1\) and
    \(h_2\) of the above half-angles with the tip circle \(t\) such that \(\angle L_nWT_n =
    \angle H_nWT_n = 2.5^{\circ}\). Draw a circle \(p\) centered at \(F\) with the radius
    \(FL_n\). Draw a circle \(q\) centered at \(F\) with the radius \(FH_n\). The space
    between \(p\) and \(q\) is the radial width of both pallets. The stopping face of the
    entry pallet will be located on the circumference of \(p\). The stopping face of the exit
    pallet will be located on the circumference of \(q\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that the point \(L_n\) lands exactly on the leading edge of the highlighted tooth.
    Further, let \(L_n\) be the lock point from the Cycle of Operation sketches above.
    Incidentally, this event - a tooth coming into a contact with a pallet - is confusingly
    called <dfn> a drop</dfn> elsewhere in literature where it is sometimes said that
    <dfn>the tooth drops onto the pallet</dfn>. We shall avoid this confusion and call this
    event a lock.
    </p>

    <p>
    For the OpenSCAD drawing we observe here that we obtain the magnitudes of the outer and
    the innder radii of the fork \(FL_n\) and \(FH_n\) using the law of cosines since all the
    angles and required sides of the triangles are known:
    </p>

$$FL_n^2 = R_t^2 + WF^2 - 2R_t \times WF \times \cos\Big( \frac {\theta_s}{2} + \frac {\theta_w}{2}\Big)$$
$$FH_n^2 = R_t^2 + WF^2 - 2R_t \times WF \times \cos\Big( \frac {\theta_s}{2} - \frac {\theta_w}{2}\Big)$$

    <p>
    and since all three sides and one angle are known in each triangle \(\triangle WL_nF\)
    and \(\triangle WH_nF\), the remaining angles can be found using the law of sines.
    </p>

    <p>
    8) Locate the discharge corner of the exit pallet.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let \(D_x\) be the intersection point of the tip circle \(t\) with \(p\) on the \(T_x\)
    side (see the drawing above). It may be difficult to see in the drawing but \(D_x\)
    should <dfn>not</dfn> coincide with the trailing edge of the highlighted tooth. There
    should be some amount of wiggle space between the two - the magnitude of the drop angle.
    The point \(D_x\) is the discharge corner of the exit pallet.
    </p>

    <p>
    9) Locate the lock corner of the entry pallet.
    </p>

    <p>
    Using \(L_n\) as a leg point and \(F\) as a vertex construct the lock angle in the
    direction opposite to the chosen one, counterclockwise in this case. Let \(C_n\) be the
    intersection of the remaining side \(l\) of the lock angle with \(p\) so that \(\theta_l
    = \angle L_nFC_n\). In our case this angle is \(1^{\circ}\) and \(C_n\) is the lock
    corner of the entry pallet.
    </p>

    <p>
    10) Locate the discharge corner of the entry pallet.
    </p>

    <p>
    Using \(C_n\) as a leg point and \(F\) as a vertex construct the lift angle in the
    direction opposite to the chosen one, counterclockwise in this case. Let \(D_n\) be the
    intersection of the remaining side \(f\) of the lift angle with \(q\) so that \(\theta_f
    = \angle C_nFD_n\). In our case this angle is \(2^{\circ}\) and \(D_n\) is the discharge
    corner of the entry pallet.
    </p>

    <p>
    11) To construct the impulse face of the entry pallet connect \(C_n\) and \(D_n\). The
    entry pallet is now complete:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc22.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Finish constructing the exit pallet. At this point all we have to do is construct its
    impulse face by locating its lock corner in either of two ways - using either the angles
    or the circles.
    </p>

    <p>
    12.1) To locate the lock corner of the exit pallet via the angles use \(D_x\) as a leg
    point and \(F\) as a vertex to construct the lift angle \(\theta_f\) in the direction
    opposite to the chosen one, counterclockwise in this case. Let \(C_x\) be the
    intersection of the remaining side \(f\) of the lift angle and \(q\) so that \(\theta_f
    = \angle D_xFC_x\). The point \(C_x\) is the lock corner of the  exit pallet and
    \(C_xD_x\) is its impulse face:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc23.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Optionally you may locate the lock point of the exit pallet \(L_x\) as it may be used
    in the last step of the fork construction. Using \(C_x\) as a leg point and \(F\) as a
    vertex construct the lock angle \(\theta_l\) in the direction opposite to the chosen
    one, counterclockwise in this case. Let \(L_x\) be the intersection of the remaining
    side \(l\) of the lock angle with \(q\) so that \(\theta_l = \angle C_xFL_x\). The
    point \(L_x\) is the lock point of the exit pallet.
    </p>

    <p>
    12.2) To locate the lock corner of the exit pallet via the circles extend the straight
    line \(C_nD_n\) of the impulse face of the entry pallet towards the center of the fork
    \(F\). Let us name this extended straight line \(i_n\). Construct a perpendicular
    \(o_n\) to \(i_n\) through \(F\) to locate their intersection point \(N\). Construct a
    circle \(m\) centered at \(F\) with the radius \(FN\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us call this circle an <dfn>Impulse Circle</dfn>. You probably have figured out by
    now that the extension of the impulse face of the exit pallet must also be tangent to
    the Impulse Circle - just like the extension of the impulse face of the entry pallet is.
    So all we have to do now is construct a tangent to the Impulse Circle through \(D_x\).
    In the Elements, Book \(3\) Proposition \(17\), Euclid does just that but in a rather
    complicated way - for academic reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
    A bit simpler way is to bisect the line segment \(FD_x\) to obtain the point \(Y\) on
    it such that \(FY = YD_x\) and then to construct a circle centered at \(Y\) with the
    radius \(YF\). That circle will intersect \(m\) at two points of which we need only
    one - the point \(X\). The straight line passing through \(X\) and \(D_x\) is the
    tangent sought-after. The intersection of that tangent with \(q\) and \(p\) locates
    the impulse face of the exit pallet and its lock corner \(C_x\). This is a bit more
    involved construction but we trade complexity for the depth of understanding - as the
    fork swings back and forth the points \(N\) and \(X\) also swing back and forth - along
    the circumference of the Impulse Circle:

    <p>
    One consequence of using the Impulse Circle is that if you decide to make the pallets
    composite - attachable to and detachable from the arms - then you can construct the
    auxiliary pallets on \(p\) and \(q\) by picking an appropriate points on them and
    then constructing the tangents to the Impulse Circle to locate the impulse faces of
    both pallets. Before we look at this procedure let us finish constructing the fork.
    </p>

    <p>
    13) Finish constructing the fork.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is where the science mostly ends and the art mostly begins. Just make sure that
    the arms of the fork are symmetrical about the line of centers \(c\) and that the
    lengths of the internal arcs along \(q\) - the arc \(Q_nD_n\) and the arc \(Q_xC_x\) -
    are large enough to secure the free movement of the fork so that its arms do not hit
    the tips of the teeth of the escape wheel during the engagements. Other than that you
    can make the space trapped above the teeth and below the arms of the fork as decorative
    as you wish. When and if decorating the outer portion of the fork make sure that the
    adjacent gears can run freely.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the drawing below the angles used to locate the points \(Q_n\) and \(Q_x\) are shown.
    The reason the magnitudes of these angles are different is because the line of centers
    \(c\) always remains strictly vertical but the axis of facial symmetry of the fork
     \(FW'\) does not as it swings with the pendulum and we constructed the fork when
    it is caught in one of its extreme positions. Therefore you can either construct these
    angles based on the line of centers \(c\), as shown, or based on the line of symmetry
    \(FW'\). The procedure to find \(FW'\) is also shown: extend the straight line \(FL_x\)
    until it intersects \(p\) at \(L'_x\), bisect the line segment \(L_nL'_x\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc25.png" class="center">

    <p>
    If using \(FW'\) - make \(\angle W'FQ_n = \angle W'FQ_x = \theta\) where \(\theta\) is
    a number you pick. If using \(c\) - compensate for the deviation of \(FW'\) from \(c\):
    </p>

$$\angle WFQ_n = \theta - \frac {\theta_l + \theta_f}{2}$$
$$\angle WFQ_x = \theta + \frac {\theta_l + \theta_f}{2}$$

    <p>
    To construct a set of auxiliary pallets in one drawing reflect the point \(C_n\) about
    the point \(O_n\), for example. Construct a circle centered at \(O_n\) with the radius
    \(O_nC_n\). That circle will intersect \(p\) at \(C'_n\). Construct a tangent to \(m\)
    through \(C'_n\). That tangent, \(C'_nN'\) will intersect \(q\) at \(D'_n\). The line
    segment \(C'_nD'_n\) is the impulse face of an auxiliary entry pallet:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc26.png" class="center">

    <p>
    When constructing the impulse face of an auxiliary exit pallet (not shown) draw the
    tangent to the impulse circle towards the center of the escape wheel \(W\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Now that we understand how to construct a fork with equidistant impulse faces the
    procedure to construct a fork with equidistant stopping faces requires little new
    material. We go back to the drawing where we have located the center of the fork \(F\).
    The points \(T_n\) and \(T_x\) now must belong to the stopping surfaces \(S_n\) and
    \(S_x\) of both pallets. As such - construct a circle \(p\) centered at \(F\) with the
    radius \(FT_n = FT_x\). The radial width of the entry pallet will extend
    <dfn>inside</dfn> \(p\) <dfn>towards</dfn> \(F\) while the radial width of the exit
    pallet will extend <dfn>outside</dfn> of \(p\) <dfn>away from</dfn> \(F\).
    </p>

    <p>
    6') Construct the radial width of the entry pallet.<br>
    Assume that the tooth of the escape wheel just kissed (locked on to) the entry pallet.
    By analogy with the equidistant impulse faces construction it means the points \(T_n\)
    and \(L_n\) are the same - the point \(T_n\) now plays the role of the lock point of
    the entry pallet.
    </p>

    <p>
    With \(W\) as a vertex and \(T_n\) as a leg point construct the \(\theta_w\) angle in
    the direction opposite to the chosen one, counterclockwise in this case. The
    intersection of the remaining side \(h_n\) of \(\theta_w\) with \(t\) locates \(H_n\).
    Construct a circle \(q_n\) centered at \(F\) with the radius \(FH_n\). The space between
    \(p\) and \(q_n\) is the radial width of the entry pallet:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc27.png" class="center">

    <p>
    7') Construct the radial width of the exit pallet.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since \(T_x\) belongs to two circumferences at once - that of the tip circle and that
    of the impulse face, we can use it as a leg point to find the radial width of the exit
    pallet. By doing so we will automatically locate one of the extreme points of the
    exit pallet - its discharge corner. This is similar to what we did in the equidistant
    impulse faces construction process.
    </p>

    <p>
    With \(W\) as a vertex and \(T_x\) as a leg point construct the \(\theta_w\) angle in
    the chosen direction, clockwise in this case. The intersection of the remaining side
    \(h_x\) of \(\theta_w\) with \(t\) locates \(D_x\). Construct a circle \(q_x\) centered
    at \(F\) with the radius \(FD_x\). The space between \(p\) and \(q_x\) is the radial
    width of the exit pallet and \(D_x\) is its discharge corner.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once the lock point of the entry pallet and the discharge corner of the exit pallet are
    located the remaining equidistant impulse faces constructions steps \(8\) through \(13\)
    can be repeated verbatim.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that in the sample procedure above I chose a lock point on the stopping face of the
    entry pallet to start the construction. You might choose the stopping face of the exit
    pallet for that purpose just as well.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you want to construct an escape wheel which rotates counterclockwise simply change
    the directions specified in the above procedures to the opposite.
