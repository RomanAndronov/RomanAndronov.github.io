    <br><strong>Law of Motion</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    As it is customary in physics which, as was duly noted, produces exact solutions for
    approximate problems, we shall at first eliminate some number of practical phenomena
    from the study of pendulum's motion. We shall discard the friction, the sound waves
    production, the reactionary forces of the pivot assembly, the mass of the pendulum's
    rod, its geometry change due to motion, the air resistance and a plethora of atmospheric
    factors like pressure, temperature, humidity, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
    Such an arrangement of a point mass \(m\) swinging at the end of an absolutely
    rigid massless rod of length \(l\) about a fixed point in a uniform gravitational
    field is called a <dfn>mathematical</dfn> or <dfn>ideal</dfn> or <dfn>simple</dfn>
    (gravity) pendulum.
    </p>

    <p>
    To find a practically useful information - the length of the rod \(l\) for a known
    period \(T\) we first need to find the pendulum's law of motion. We shall derive it
    in three ways - via Newton, Torque and Lagrange.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Newton</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Before we jump to the equations let us talk about pendulum's motion at the gut or
    intuitive level. When the pendulum is at rest it occupies the position along the
    equilibrium line \(ZO\). The force due to gravity \(mg\) is balanced by the rod's
    tension force \(N\), the pendulum's velocity is zero and so are its acceleration,
    kinetic and potential energies. Using our muscle power we move the pendulum to its
    left extreme position, point \(A\), and let it go.
    </p>

    <p>
    At this extreme point \(A\) (as well as at \(B\)) the magnitude of \(m\)'s
    normal acceleration \(a_n\) which points directly at \(Z\) and tracks the change
    of <dfn>direction</dfn> of \(m\)'s velocity is the smallest and so are the
    magnitudes of the tension force \(N\) and \(m\)'s kinetic energy. The magnitude of
    the tangential acceleration \(a_{\tau}\) which is tangent to \(m\)'s trajectory and
    tracks the change of <dfn>magnitude</dfn> of \(m\)'s velocity is the largest and
    so is \(m\)'s potential energy. After being zero for an instance the magnitude of
    \(m\)'s velocity \(v\) grows quickly at first and at that stage vectors \(a_{\tau}\)
    and \(v\) point in the same direction - towards the equilibrium point \(O\). The
    magnitude and the direction of the force due to gravity \(mg\) remains constant at all
    times.
    </p>

    <p>
    By the time \(m\) arrives at \(O\) it covers one quarter of its period. The
    magnitudes of \(m\)'s \(a_n\), \(N\), \(v\) and kinetic energy reach their maximums
    while the magnitudes of its \(a_{\tau}\) and potential energy are at their lowest.
    As \(m\) moves away from \(O\) towards \(B\) the magnitudes of \(a_n\), \(N\) and
    \(v\) begin to shrink, \(a_{\tau}\) becomes negative as \(m\) begins to slow down
    and as a result vectors \(a_{\tau}\) and \(v\) point in different directions -
    \(a_{\tau}\) points towards \(O\) again while \(v\) points towards \(B\).
    </p>

    <p>
    By the time \(m\) arrives at \(B\) it covers one half of its period. The
    magnitudes of \(m\)'s \(a_n\), \(N\), \(v\) and kinetic energy reach their minimums
    while the magnitudes of \(a_{\tau}\) and potential energy reach their maximums. The
    velocity of \(m\) changes its direction towards \(O\) and begins to grow, \(a_{\tau}\)
    points in the same direction and the above \(A\) to \(O\) scenario plays out again but
    this time in the opposite direction, from \(B\) to \(O\). At \(O\) \(m\) covers three
    quarters of its period and by the time it reaches \(A\) again the entire period is
    covered:
    </p>

    <p>
    According to Newton's second law the vector sum of all the forces acting on a
    body equals the first derivative of \(mv\) over time. Let us project these forces
    on the \(\tau\) axis that runs perpendicular to \(ZP\) where \(P\) is the location
    of the point mass \(m\) at an arbitrary time \(t\). Since the mass remains constant,
    we take the derivative of \(v_{\tau}\) only:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\frac {d}{dt}(mv_{\tau}) = m\frac{dv_{\tau}}{dt}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    where \(v_{\tau}\) is \(m\)'s velocity. As a vector \(v_{\tau}\) is always
    tangential to \(m\)'s trajectory and it is the first derivative of the length
    of \(m\)'s path \(s\) over time:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
v_{\tau} = \frac {ds}{dt}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Since the rod is rigid, \(m\) traces a circular arc. Therefore we can express \(s\) as
    a function of an angle \(\theta\) if the latter itself is expressed in <dfn>radians</dfn>.
    From the definition of a radian we have:
    </p>

$$s = l\times\theta$$

    <p>
    Therefore for very very small portions of the path \(ds\) we have:
    </p>

$$ds = ld\theta$$

    <p>
    Putting \(ds\) back into (2) and \(v_{\tau}\) into (1) we get:
    </p>

$$v_{\tau} = \frac {ds}{dt} = \frac {ld\theta}{dt} = l\dot{\theta}$$
$$m\frac{dv_{\tau}}{dt} = m\frac {d( l\dot{\theta})}{dt} = ml\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}
= ml\ddot{\theta}$$

    <p>
    The projection of the vector \(N\) on \(\tau\) is zero since the two are orthogonal.
    To project \(mg\) on \(\tau\) we observe that the straight lines \(ZO\) and \(PC\)
    are dead verticals and hence are parallel - the size of our pendulum's rod \(l\) is
    way smaller than the radius of Earth whose curvature we ignore in this case. This of
    course is an idealization since strictly speaking the verticals are the straight lines
    that pass through the center of the Earth, they are perpendicular to the spherical
    surface of the Earth and as such are not really parallel. Approximating the shape of
    the Earth with a sphere is yet another idealization.
    </p>

    <p>
    The straight lines \(ZP\) and \(CD\) are both perpendicular to the same straight line
    \(\tau\) and hence are parallel. The straight line \(CD\) when extended intersects
    \(ZO\) at \(D'\) and hence by definition the quadrilateral \(ZPCD'\) is a parallelogram
    in which, according to Euclid (Elements, Book 1 Proposition 34), the opposite angles are
    equal which in turn means that \(\angle OZP = \angle PCD = \theta\).
    </p>

    <p>
    The force \(F_{\tau}\) that always points towards \(O\) is a restoring force - its
    direction is always opposite to that of \(m\)'s angular displacement. It means that if
    we displace \(m\) in one direction then \(F_{\tau}\) would always act in the opposite
    direction as it would want to bring \(m\) to its equilibrium point \(O\). For example,
    at \(P\) the angle \(\theta\) is measured clockwise relative to the vertical \(ZO\) -
    the equilibrium line - and hence we take it to be negative while \(F_{\tau}\) points in
    the opposite direction, as it wants to move \(m\) counterclockwise, and we take it to be
    positive. If \(P\) were on the other side of \(O\), closer to \(B\), then the angle
    \(\theta\) would have been measured counterclockwise, positive, while \(F_{\tau}\) would
    be pointing against this displacement and we would take it to be negative. This restoring
    behavior is captured with the minus sign:
    </p>

$$F_{\tau} = -mg\sin(\theta)$$

    <p>
    Find the analogy here with an ideal spring obeying Hooke's law where the restoring
    force \(F = -k\Delta x\) is proportional to a linear measure, \(\Delta x\), while
    in our case the restoring force is proportional to an angular measure.
    </p>

    <p>
    So finally we have:
    </p>

$$ml\ddot{\theta} = -mg\sin(\theta)$$
$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{\ddot{\theta} + \frac {g}{l}\sin(\theta) = 0}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Torque</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Torques and angular momenta make sense only when the reference point is
    specified. In our case the reference point is \(Z\) and \(ZP\) is \(m\)'s
    radius vector with a known and constant length \(l\).
    </p>

    <p>
    On the one hand, \(m\)'s torque relative to \(Z\) is the cross product of two
    vectors:
    </p>

$$\vec{\tau_Z} = \vec{l} \times \vec{mg}$$
$$\tau_Z = -lmg\sin(\theta)$$

    <p>
    On the other hand, it is the first derivative of \(m\)'s angular momentum \(L\)
    relative to \(Z\) over time:
    </p>

$$\vec{\tau_Z} = \frac {d\vec{L_Z}}{dt}$$

    <p>
    Since we agreed that the size of the point mass \(m\) is much smaller than
    \(l\), for its angular momentum we have:
    </p>

$$\vec{L_Z} = \vec{l} \times \vec{mv}$$
$$L_Z = lmv = lm\omega l = ml^2\frac {d\theta}{dt} = ml^2\dot{\theta}$$
$$\tau_Z = \frac {d (ml^2\dot{\theta})}{dt} = ml^2\ddot{\theta}$$

    <p>
    since \(m\) and \(l\) remain constant over time. Equating the two expressions
    we get:
    </p>

$$-mgl\sin(\theta) = ml^2\ddot{\theta}$$
$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{\ddot{\theta} + \frac {g}{l}\sin(\theta) = 0}$$

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Lagrange</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Our simple pendulum can execute an independent motion in only one plane. The nature
    of this motion is such that just one variable, the angle \(\theta\), is enough to
    fully describe it. Consequently our pendulum possesses only one degree of freedom
    and its Lagrangian in terms of \(\theta\) is:
    </p>

$$L = T - U$$
$$T = \frac {mv^2}{2} = \frac {ml^2\dot{\theta}^2}{2}$$
$$U = mgl(1 - \cos(\theta))$$
$$L = \frac {ml^2\dot{\theta}^2}{2} - mgl + mgl\cos(\theta)$$

    <p>
    Since there is only one degree of freedom, the Euler-Lagrangian equations
    split into just one:
    </p>

$$\frac {d}{dt} \frac {\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} =
\frac {\partial L}{\partial \theta}$$
$$\frac {\partial L}{\partial \dot{\theta}} = ml^2\dot{\theta}$$
$$\frac {d(ml^2\dot{\theta})}{dt} = ml^2\ddot{\theta}$$
$$\frac {\partial L}{\partial \theta} = -mgl\sin(\theta)$$

    <p>
    So finally we have:
    </p>

$$ml^2\ddot{\theta} = -mgl\sin(\theta)$$
$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{\ddot{\theta} + \frac {g}{l}\sin(\theta) = 0}$$

    <p>
    By solving the above equation we hope to obtain the behavior of the angle
    \(\theta\) as a function of time. Before we do that however let us record the
    remaining entities as a function of the angle \(\theta\).
    </p>

    <p>
    We obtain \(v\) from the law of conservation of energy. Since the tension force
    \(N\) is always perpendicular to \(v\), it does not do any work. The force due
    to gravity \(mg\) is conservative - it does not do any work either. Hence, the
    entire change in \(m\)'s potential energy is translated into the change of its
    kinetic energy:
    </p>

$$mg\Delta h = mg(h_0 - h) = mg(l - l\cos(\theta_0) - l + l\cos(\theta))$$
$$mgl(\cos(\theta) - \cos(\theta_0)) = \frac {mv^2}{2}$$
$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{v(\theta) = \sqrt{2gl(\cos(\theta) - \cos(\theta_0))}}$$

    <p>
    Both accelerations follow:
    </p>

$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{a_{\tau}(\theta) = -g\sin(\theta)}$$
$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{a_n(\theta) = \frac {v^2}{l} = 2g(\cos(\theta) - \cos(\theta_0))}$$

    <p>
    To find \(N\) we project it and \(mg\) on the normal axis \(ZP\):
    </p>

$$ma_n = N - F_n = N - mg\cos(\theta)$$
$$N = ma_n + mg\cos(\theta) = 2mg(\cos(\theta) - \cos(\theta_0)) + mg\cos(\theta)$$
$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{N(\theta) = 3mg\cos(\theta) - 2mg\cos(\theta_0)}$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Solution</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We rearrange (3) like so:
    </p>

$$\ddot{\theta} = -\frac {g}{l}\sin(\theta)$$

    <p>
    To save us some typing we designate:
    </p>

$$\omega^2 = \frac {g}{l}$$
$$\begin{equation}
\ddot{\theta} = -\omega^2 \sin(\theta)
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Spell out the definition of a derivative \(\ddot{\theta}\) on the left hand side
    of (4) and then multiply both sides of (4) by \(dt\):
    </p>

$$\ddot{\theta} = \frac {d\dot{\theta}}{dt} = -\omega^2 \sin(\theta)$$
$$\begin{equation}
d\dot{\theta} = -\omega^2 \sin(\theta)dt
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Multiply both sides of (5) by \(\dot{\theta}\) and expand its definition on the
    right hand side:
    </p>

$$\dot{\theta}d\dot{\theta} = -\omega^2 \sin(\theta)dt\dot{\theta} =
-\omega^2 \sin(\theta)dt \frac {d\theta}{dt} = -\omega^2 \sin(\theta)d\theta$$
$$\begin{equation}
\dot{\theta}d\dot{\theta} = -\omega^2 \sin(\theta)d\theta
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    What we managed to do now is to completely separate the variables which means
    that we can integrate both sides of (6):
    </p>

$$\int \dot{\theta}d\dot{\theta} = \frac {\dot{\theta}^2}{2} + const_1$$
$$\int -\omega^2 \sin(\theta)d\theta = \omega^2 \cos(\theta) + const_2$$
$$\frac {\dot{\theta}^2}{2} + const_1 = \omega^2 \cos(\theta) + const_2$$
$$\begin{equation}
\frac {\dot{\theta}^2}{2} = \omega^2 \cos(\theta) + C
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Use the boundary conditions to find \(C\):
    </p>

$$\theta(t = 0) = \theta_0$$
$$\dot{\theta}(t = 0) = 0$$
$$0 = \omega^2 \cos(\theta_0) + C$$
$$C = -\omega^2 \cos(\theta_0)$$

    <p>
    Put \(C\) into (7):
    </p>

$$\frac {\dot{\theta}^2}{2} = \omega^2 \cos(\theta) - \omega^2 \cos(\theta_0)$$
$$\dot{\theta}^2 = 2\omega^2(\cos(\theta) - \cos(\theta_0))$$
$$\begin{equation}
\dot{\theta} = \omega\sqrt{2}\sqrt{\cos(\theta) - \cos(\theta_0)}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Use the power reduction half-angle trigonometric identity:
    </p>

$$\cos(x) = 1 - 2\sin^2\Big(\frac {x}{2}\Big)$$

    <p>
    for both cosines under the square root in (8):
    </p>

$$\dot{\theta} = \omega\sqrt{2}\sqrt{1 - 2\sin^2\Big(\frac{\theta}{2}\Big) - 1
+ 2\sin^2\Big(\frac{\theta_0}{2}\Big)}$$
$$\dot{\theta} = \frac {d\theta}{dt} =
2\omega\sqrt{\sin^2\Big(\frac{\theta_0}{2}\Big) - \sin^2\Big(\frac{\theta}{2}\Big)}$$

    <p>
    Separate the variables one more time:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
dt = \frac {1}{2\omega}
\frac {d\theta}{\sqrt{\sin^2\Big(\frac{\theta_0}{2}\Big) -
\sin^2\Big(\frac{\theta}{2}\Big)}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Integrate the left hand side of (9) from \(0\) to \(\frac{T}{4}\) - for one
    quarter of the period. Integrate the right hand side of (9) from \(0\) to
    \(\theta_0\):
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
T(\theta_0) = \frac {2}{\omega}\int_0^{\theta_0}
\frac {d\theta}{\sqrt{\sin^2\Big(\frac{\theta_0}{2}\Big) -
\sin^2\Big(\frac{\theta}{2}\Big)}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Within the given integral \(\sin\Big(\frac{\theta_0}{2}\Big)\) is just a
    constant, designate it as:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
k = \sin\Big(\frac{\theta_0}{2}\Big)
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    And use the following substitution:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\sin\Big(\frac{\theta}{2}\Big) = k\sin(\phi)
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Differentiate (12):
    </p>

$$\frac {d\theta}{2}\cos\Big(\frac{\theta}{2}\Big) = k\cos(\phi)d\phi$$
$$\begin{equation}
d\theta = \frac {2k\cos(\phi)d\phi}{\cos\Big(\frac{\theta}{2}\Big)}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Use the basic trigonometric identity \(\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1\) and (12)
    for the cosine in the denominator of (13):
    </p>

$$\cos\Big(\frac{\theta}{2}\Big) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2\Big(\frac{\theta}{2}\Big)} =
\sqrt{1 - k^2\sin^2(\phi)}$$

    <p>
    And put it back into (13):
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
d\theta = \frac {2k\cos(\phi)d\phi}{\sqrt{1 - k^2\sin^2(\phi)}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Use (12) to rearrange the difference of the squares of sines under the square
    root in (10):
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\sin^2\Big(\frac{\theta_0}{2}\Big) - \sin^2\Big(\frac{\theta}{2}\Big) =
k^2(1 - \sin^2(\phi)) = k^2\cos^2(\phi)
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Change the boundaries of integration using (12):
    </p>

$$\theta = 0, \; \sin\Big(\frac{0}{2}\Big) = 0 = k\sin(\phi), \; \phi = 0$$
$$\theta = \theta_0, \; \sin\Big(\frac{\theta_0}{2}\Big) =
\sin\Big(\frac{\theta_0}{2}\Big)\sin(\phi), \; \phi = \frac {\pi}{2}$$

    <p>
    Put (14) and (15) into (10) and reverse substitute \(\omega\):
    </p>

$$T(k) = \frac {4}{\omega}\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}
\frac {k\cos(\phi)}{\sqrt{1 - k^2\sin^2(\phi)}} \frac {d\phi}{k\cos(\phi)}$$

$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{T(k) = 4\sqrt{\frac {l}{g}}\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}
\frac {d\phi}{\sqrt{1 - k^2\sin^2(\phi)}}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Though a French mathematician A. Legendre was working with functions of complex
    variables \(z\) (circa 1825-1837) with a substitution \(z = \sin(\phi)\) he was able
    to simplify a somewhat different but similarly looking integral to the form you see
    above. He called it an <dfn>elliptic integral of the first kind</dfn> and designated
    it as \(F(k)\). Legendre normalized two other related integrals to what now known as
    a standard form. All three carry his name, the elliptic integrals of the first,
    second and third kinds in the Legendre form.
    </p>

    <p>
    If the upper boundary of the integrals is \(\frac {\pi}{2}\) they are called 
    <dfn>complete</dfn>, otherwise, if it is an arbitrary angle \(\phi\), they are called
    <dfn>incomplete</dfn> and designated as a function of two arguments, \(\phi\) being
    the second argument. For example, \(F(k, \phi)\) stands for an incomplete elliptic
    integral of the first kind.
    </p>

    <p>
    These integrals have been studied to a great depth and their numeric values
    can be estimated to a high degree of accuracy in a multitude of ways. Using
    Legendre polynomials and the works of J. Wallis, for example, our particular
    integral of the first kind can be exactly represented as an infinite sum:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
F(k) = \int_{0}^{\frac {\pi}{2}}
\frac {d\phi}{\sqrt{1 - k^2\sin^2(\phi)}} =
\frac {\pi}{2} \sum_{n=0}^{n=\infty}
\bigg[\Bigg(\frac {(2n)!}{(2^n \cdot n!)^2} \Bigg)^2
\cdot \sin^{2n}\Big(\frac {\theta_0}{2} \Big)\bigg]
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    where \(n\) is a whole number: 0, 1, 2, 3, ... etc. Putting it back into (16)
    we get:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
T(\theta_0) = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac {l}{g}}\sum_{n=0}^{n=\infty}
\bigg[\Bigg(\frac {(2n)!}{(2^n \cdot n!)^2} \Bigg)^2
\cdot \sin^{2n}\Big(\frac {\theta_0}{2} \Big)\bigg]
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    It may be difficult to see but notice that \(4\) became \(2\) and \(\pi\) was
    added. The first few terms of the above sum are:
    </p>

$$T(\theta_0) = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac {l}{g}}\Big(1 +
\frac {1}{4}\sin^2\Big(\frac {\theta_0}{2} \Big) +
\frac {9}{64}\sin^4\Big(\frac {\theta_0}{2} \Big) + 
\frac {25}{256}\sin^6\Big(\frac {\theta_0}{2} \Big) + \dots \Big)$$

    <p>
    In clock making, however, the pendulum's period \(T\) is known ahead of time while the
    length of its rod \(l\) corresponding to that period must be found. If we decide to
    use (17) for the integral estimate then we can designate the sum in (18) as
    \(S\):
    </p>

$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac {l}{g}}S$$

    <p>
    and solve it for \(l\):
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{l(T, \theta_0) = \frac {g}{4\pi^2}\Big(\frac {T}{S}\Big)^2}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    where you have to decide on the number of terms in the sum \(S\). In a generic case
    that sum will be a function of \(\theta_0\).
    </p>

    <p>
    If you find a different way to calculate the integral (16) then we can name it
    as \(I\):
    </p>

$$T(\theta_0) = 4\sqrt{\frac {l}{g}}I$$

    <p>
    and solve it for \(l\):
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{l(T, \theta_0) = g\Big(\frac {T}{4I}\Big)^2}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Keep in mind that \(\theta_0\) must be <dfn>expressed</dfn> in radians for the
    above calculations to work. It is highly likely that you will measure or decide
    on the value of \(\theta_0\) in degrees \(d\) so here is how to convert them
    into radians \(r\):
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
r = \frac {\pi}{180} \cdot d
\end{equation}$$

    Before moving on to small angles I will remark in passing that traditionally, after
    obtaining the integral in (16), we hope to calculate it and then invert that solution
    to obtain an expression for \(\theta(t)\). Unfortunately the analytic or closed form
    solution for the integral in (16) does not exist. However, the behavior of the angle
    \(\theta\) as a function of time can obtained via the elliptic function \(sn()\) of
    Carl Jacobi who, after inverting the integral in (16) in particular and further
    developing the theory of elliptic functions in general, used to famously say "One
    must always invert!":
    </p>

$$\theta(t) = 2\arcsin(k \times sn(\sqrt{\frac{g}{l}}t, k))$$

    <p>
    where \(k\) is some periodic function. This, however, is way beyond the scope of
    this tutorial.

    There seem to be no end in sight to wonders in math which uncovers things that are
    true but neither intuitive nor obvious. One such wonder is the fact that functions
    that have nothing to do with polynomials can be expressed via the very things they
    have nothing to do with - polynomials of infinite degree.
    </p>

    <p>
    In 1712 an English mathematician Brook Taylor formalized the work done by a Scottish
    mathematician James Gregory in a form of a theorem, published in 1715, which states
    that a function possessing derivatives of all orders at a point \(x = a\) can be
    expressed as a polynomial whose coefficients depend <dfn>only</dfn> on the values of
    derivatives of the function at \(a\). Such representation of a function, in general,
    is now called Taylor series.
    </p>

    <p>
    Infinity is a convenient mathematical concept but in practice of course you will not
    be summing an infinite number of terms and you will not be raising a term to an infinite
    power. You will pick some reasonable finite number of terms and by doing so you will
    introduce a certain error. The upper bound of that error is addressed by the Taylor
    theorem but for the purposes of our discussion it is an overkill to cover it here. We
    will, however, look at the small angle error in the pendulum's length calculation below.
    </p>

    <p>
    What makes Taylor series quite remarkable is the fact that we can estimate a value
    of a function at a certain point (I am glossing over a large amount of gory details
    here) using only four basic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication and
    division - something that computers are good at.
    </p>

    <p>
    An approximating series of a function in the vicinity of a specific point, zero,
    is sometimes called a Maclaurin series in memory of a Scottish mathematician Colin
    Maclaurin, Isaac Newton's disciple. Defending his teacher's analytic methods against
    the bitter criticism by the contemporaries Maclaurin published one of the first known
    systematic treatments of the subject, <dfn>"A Treatise of Fluxions"</dfn>, in 1842.
    This work was so well and carefully done that it became a sort of an academic standard
    in Europe for the next almost 80 years. In 1821 a French mathematician Augustin Cauchy
    published his famous analysis course that introduced a level of mathematical rigor never
    dreamed of by Newton and Leibniz and, pretty much, put mathematical analysis as we now
    know and love it on the academic map.
    </p>

    <p>
    Our prime suspect in (3) is \(\sin(\theta)\). Keeping the angle \(\theta\) expressed in
    radians let us use Taylor (Maclaurin) series in the vicinity of \(\theta = 0\) to
    represent \(\sin(\theta)\) as a polynomial (of infinite degree):
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\sin(\theta) = \theta - \frac {\theta^3}{3!} + \frac {\theta^5}{5!} -
\frac {\theta^7}{7!} + \dots = \sum_{n=0}^{n=\infty}
\frac {-1^n}{(2n+1)!}\theta^{2n+1}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    To get a sense for the actual numbers here is what some small and not so small angles
    look like:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pgc02.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Further, here is what (22) looks like for four degrees expressed in radians:
    </p>

$$4^\circ = \frac {3.14159 \times 4}{180} = 0.0698131111 \; r$$
$$\sin(0.0698131111) = 0.0698131111 - 0.0000567100 + 0.0000000138 - \cdots$$

    <p>
    We see that starting from as close as the second term the numbers become so small
    and contribute so little to the grand total that we can throw all of them out and
    keep the first term only:
    </p>

$$\sin(0.0698131111) \approx 0.0698131111$$

    <p>
    or in general for very small angles:
    </p>

$$\sin(\theta) \approx \theta$$

    <p>
    If we now put the above approximation of \(\sin(\theta)\) back into (3) we get:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\ddot{\theta} + \frac {g}{l}\theta = 0
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    I leave it as an exercise for you to solve this equation using the separation
    of variables approach described above. Eventually you will come to the following
    integral:
    </p>

$$\int \frac {d\theta}{\sqrt{\theta_0^2 - \theta^2}}$$

    <p>
    which you can calculate with the \(\theta = \theta_0\sin(\phi)\) substitution
    to obtain the period \(T\):
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac {l}{g}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    which is the limiting case of (18) when only the first term of the sum is kept. We
    now see why for small angles the period of our idealized pendulum does not depend on
    \(\theta_0\) (and \(m\)).
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that if we replace the angular coordinate \(\theta\) with a generic coordinate
    \(q\) then purely mathematically we can abstract (23) as:
    </p>

$$\ddot q + \omega^2 q = 0$$

    <p>
    which is applicable to: our simple pendulum, a point mass oscillating on an ideal
    spring, a current flowing through an LC circuit. For a simple pendulum \(q\) means 
    <dfn>angle</dfn> and
    </p>

$$\omega = \sqrt{ \frac {g}{l}}$$

    <p>
    For a point mass on an ideal spring \(q\) means <dfn>linear distance</dfn> and
    </p>

$$\omega = \sqrt{ \frac {k}{m}}$$

    <p>
    For a current flowing through an LC circuit \(q\) means <dfn>current</dfn> and
    </p>

$$\omega = \frac {1}{\sqrt{LC}}$$

    <p>
    All three examples can be covered under one umbrella of the concept known as <dfn>simple
    harmonic oscillator</dfn> for which the behavior of the abstract coordinate as a function
    of time can be expressed in closed form. When you were solving (23) for your substitution
    for an arbitrary time \(t\) you had \(\phi = \omega t\) and for the angle you had
    \(\theta(t) = \theta_0\cos(\omega t + \delta)\). Replacing \(\theta\) with \(q\) we get:
    </p>

$$q(t) = q_0\cos(\omega t + \delta)$$

    <p>
    where \(\delta\) is known as a <dfn>phase</dfn> which captures the initial state of motion.
    </p>

    <br><strong>\(g\), \(\pi\), Reality</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    While other factors affect the exact value of \(g\) the two major ones are elevation
    above or submersion below sea level and latitude.
    </p>

    <p>
    Elevation/submersion. The value of \(g\) becomes smaller and smaller as you get farther
    and farther away from the surface of the Earth in either direction - away from or closer
    to the center of the Earth. And conversely. It may be intuitively clear why the value
    of \(g\) diminishes as you get away from the Earth's center but why does it happen
    when you get closer to it? At the risk of straying off topic too much here is an
    explanation in broad strokes.
    </p>

    <p>
    Break a solid sphere of uniform density into a very large number of very thin and
    hollow shells of uniform density. Because of the equality of the angles involved and
    the inverse proportionality of the gravitational forces to the squares of distances
    the gravitational pull of such a shell on a point mass located anywhere
    <dfn>inside</dfn> the shell is zero. A gravitational pull of a uniform sphere of mass
    \(M\) on a point mass located anywhere <dfn>outside</dfn> the sphere is equivalent to
    a pull of a material point of mass \(M\) located at sphere's center. Apply this model
    to Earth. As we get deeper and deeper inside our planet we bypass more and more such
    shells which we can safely throw out - they contribute nothing to the current value
    of \(g\). The mass of the remaining not yet penetrated sphere diminishes and so is
    \(g\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Latitude. Earth is not a perfect sphere - it can be approximated with a high degree
    of accuracy with a spinning oblate ellipsoid. As such Earth's radius varies with
    your clock's position on our planet - it is smallest at the poles and largest at the
    equator. Consequently, the value of \(g\) starts out at the highest value at the poles,
    \(g_p\), and diminishes slightly as you get closer and closer to the equator, \(g_{eq}\).
    And conversely:
    </p>

$$g_p = g(90^{\circ}) = 9.83236 \; m \times s^{-2}$$
$$g = g(45^{\circ}) = 9.80665 \; m \times s^{-2}$$
$$g_{eq} = g(0^{\circ}) = 9.78033 \; m \times s^{-2}$$

    <p>
    Here degrees stand for the latitude and the unsubscripted \(g\) stands for
    <dfn>standard gravity</dfn> whose value is used for definitions and unit conversions.
    You may experiment with using it in your calculations but you should really use the
    clock's locale-specific value. For example, you can look it up in a published table -
    the burden to find one is on you. Keep in mind that when it comes to measurements
    lone magnitudes like \(9.806\) by themselves are useless. They become worthy of
    attention only when an error is given as in \(9.806 \pm 0.003\). Such errors tell us
    the degree of uncertainty of a measurement. However, I will mostly deviate from this
    practice in this tutorial.
    </p>

    <p>
    In US a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (www.noaa.gov) has a branch
    called National Geodesic Survey (www.ngs.noaa.gov) which, at the time of this writing
    (2015), provided a Surface Gravity Prediction calculator
    (www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/grav_pdx.prl) which accepted latitude, longtitude and height
    as input for continental US only. For New York City, NY, (latitude \(40.714167^\circ\),
    longtitude \(74.006389^\circ\), elevation \(4.66 \; m\)) it produced the following estimate:
    </p>

$$g = 9.80252 \; m \times s^{-2}$$


    <p>
    If for calculation purposes you need to convert the coordinates from the minutes \(M\) and
    seconds \(S\) format into a decimal format \(d\) then use the following formula:
    </p>

$$d = \theta^{\circ} + \frac {M}{60} + \frac {S}{3600}$$

    <p>
    For NYC, NY, for example, we get:
    </p>

$$d_{lat} = 40^{\circ} + \frac {42'}{60} + \frac {51''}{3600} = 40.714167^{\circ}$$
$$d_{lon} = 74^{\circ} + \frac {0'}{60} + \frac {23''}{3600} = 74.006389^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    You can also estimate the local value of \(g\) at sea level by using the Helmert's formula:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
g(\phi) = 9.780327(1 + 0.0053024\sin^2(\phi) - 0.0000058\sin^2(2\phi))
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    where \(\phi\) is your latitude in degrees.
    </p>

    <p>
    If your clock will be operated above sea level at a height \(h\), measured in meters,
    then adjust (25) by subtracting an extra term from it:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
g(\phi, h) = g(\phi) - 0.000003086 \times h
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Using (26) to estimate the value of \(g\) in NYC, NY, for comparison purposes, we get:
    </p>

$$g = 9.80232 \; m \times s^{-2}$$

    <p>
    If your clock will be operated below sea level at a depth \(d\), measured in meters,
    then adjust (25) by multiplying it by an extra term:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
g(\phi, d) = g(\phi)(1 - \frac {d}{R_m})
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    where \(R_m = 6,371,009 \; m\) is the mean radius of Earth. If you feel that \(R_m\)
    is not precise enough then you can look up any number of ways to estimate the distance
    from the center of the Earth to its surface at an arbitrary latitude \(\phi\). Wiki
    is one place to start from.
    </p>

    <p>
    Overall, the chase after a more precise estimate of a locale-specific value of \(g\) is
    always on - check for the latest developments before running your calculations.
    </p>

    <p>
    Also, keep in mind that by making it possible for a massive object, bob, to slide along
    the pendulum's rod you can always fine-tune the period of your clock. If your clock runs
    fast then you slow it down by sliding the mass \(m\) down the rod away from the pivot
    point effectively increasing the magnitude of \(l\). If you clock runs slow you speed it
    up by sliding the mass \(m\) up the rod towards the pivot point effectively decreasing
    the magnitude of \(l\).
    </p>

    <p>
    The value of \(\pi\) is known with a very high degree of accuracy - way more than we
    need for our practical purposes. I will use \(\pi = 3.14159\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Lastly, it goes without saying that our nice mathematical model is <dfn>not</dfn>
    realizable in practice. In reality the period of oscillation of a pendulum <dfn>is</dfn>
    affected by the pivot assembly friction, air resistance, atmospheric pressure, temperature,
    humidity, etc. I will address the influence of friction and air resistance on \(T\) in the
    escapement chapter but I will ignore the influence of all the other factors on \(T\)
    completely.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Procedure</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Here are the steps to find the length of the simple pendulum's rod \(l\):
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>Decide on the magnitude of \(T\) in seconds</li>
     <li>Decide on the magnitude of \(\theta_0\) in degrees</li>
     <li>Convert degrees into radians with (21)</li>
     <li>Estimate the value of the integral (16)</li>
     <li>Find the locale-specific value of \(g\)</li>
     <li>Take \(\pi = 3.14159\)</li>
     <li>Put the above values into (19) or (20) to find \(l\)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Sample Calculation</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    1) We pick \(T = 2\) seconds. It means that it takes our pendulum \(1\) second
    to swing from \(A\) to \(B\) and \(1\) second to swing from \(B\) to \(A\). In
    other words this particular pendulum shows up at either extreme point every second.
    Historically it is known as <dfn>seconds pendulum</dfn> and professionals say that
    it <dfn>"beats seconds</dfn>".
    </p>

    <p>
    2) We pick \(\theta_0 = 2^{\circ}\).
    </p>

    <p>
    3) From (21) we obtain its radian measure:
    </p>

$$\theta_0^r(2^{\circ}) = \frac {3.14159}{180}\times 2^{\circ} = 0.03491$$

    <p>
    4) At first we shall do a small degree approximation by taking only the first term,
    \(1\), from \(S\) in (18) and from (19) we get:
    </p>

$$S = 1$$

    <p>
    5) We will use the value of \(g = 9.80252\) specific for NYC, NY.
    </p>

    <p>
    6) Put these numbers into (19) to obtain \(l\):
    </p>

$$l(2s, 2^{\circ}) = \frac {9.80252}{4 \times (3.14159)^2}\times 4 =
\frac {9.80252}{9.86959} = 0.99320 \; m$$
$$l = 99.32 \:cm$$

    <p>
    In other words we get \(99\) centimeters and \(3.2\) millimeters. On a separate
    note observe a numeric curiosity - the values of \(g\) and \(\pi\) squared are
    somewhat close.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now instead of just one let us take three first terms in \(S\) in (18) still
    using the \(\sin()\) in it:
    </p>

$$\frac {\theta_0^r(2^{\circ})}{2} = 0.01745$$
$$\sin(0.01745) = 0.00030$$
$$\sin^2(0.01745) = 0.00000$$
$$\sin^4(0.01745) = 0.00000$$

$$S = 1 + \frac {1}{4} \times 0.00000 + \frac {9}{64} \times 0.00000 =
1$$

    <p>
    In other words with \(2^{\circ}\) we do not get any perceptible difference for \(T\).
    What about \(4^{\circ}\)?
    </p>

$$\frac {\theta_0^r(4^{\circ})}{2} = 0.0349065555$$
$$\sin(0.0349065555) = 0.0348994671$$
$$\sin^2(0.0349065555) = 0.0012179728$$
$$\sin^4(0.0349065555) = 0.0000014834$$

$$S = 1 + \frac {1}{4} \times 0.0012179728 + \frac {9}{64} \times 0.0000014834 =
1.0003047018$$
$$S^2 = 1.0003047018^2 = 1.0006094964$$
$$l(2s, 4^{\circ}) = \frac {9.80252}{4 \times (3.14159)^2}\times
\frac {4}{1.0006094964} = 0.99260 \; m$$
$$l = 99.26 \; cm$$

    <p>
    In other words we get \(99\) centimeters and \(2.6\) millimeters. If we take it as
    a correct value than our previous one, \(99.32 \; cm\), which is off by \(0.6 \; mm\),
    introduces about \(0.06\%\) error.
    </p>

    <p>
    In a similar manner for small angles (\(S = 1\)) for NYC, NY, we obtain:
    </p>

$$l(0.5s, 4^{\circ}) = 6.21 \; cm$$
$$l(1s, 4^{\circ}) = 24.83 \; cm$$
$$l(3s, 4^{\circ}) = 2 \; m \; 23.47 \; cm$$
$$l(4s, 4^{\circ}) = 3 \; m \; 97.28 \; cm$$
$$l(5s, 4^{\circ}) = 6 \; m \; 20.75\; cm$$

    <p>
    Overall keep in mind that the lengths of a small angle simple pendulum relate as
    <dfn>squares</dfn> of its periods. If you double a period (from \(2\) to \(4\) seconds)
    you quadruple the length (from about \(1\) meter to about \(4\) meters) and conversely.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Huygens</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    By around 1637 Galileo realized that the pendulum can be used as the main part of
    a time keeping mechanism - a clock. He sketched out a preliminary design of such
    a clock and started implementing it by the summer of 1641. Unfortunately he never
    finished it as he passed away in January of 1642. The scientific marathon, however,
    was not to die with him - on December 25th of that year Isaac Newton was born. In
    England.
    </p>

    <p>
    A friar of a Parisian order of Minims, the author of the special kind of numbers of
    the form \(2^n - 1\), left a well known trace in number theory. It is less well known
    that while running a hard sciences informational hub out of the rooms of his Franciscan
    convent Marin Mersenne left a trace in physics as well as he was the one who suggested
    to a Dutch scientist and mathematician Christiaan Huygens the use of pendulums in time
    keeping.
    </p>

    <p>
    The devil is in the details and it took the intellectual power of Huygens to work these
    details out around 1656-1657 and invent a first known practical rigid rod pendulum clock.
    A physical functioning copy of this clock, built by someone else, was unveiled by Huygens
    on December 25th 1657 while its inner workings were described in 1658 in a small book
    <dfn>"Horologium"</dfn>. A good friar Marin Mesenne did not live to witness this historic
    moment as he passed away in 1648.
    </p>

    <p>
    Eventually Huygens realized that a rigid rod pendulum tracing a circular arc is not
    <dfn>isochronous</dfn> (from the Greek <dfn>"iso"</dfn> meaning <dfn>equal</dfn> and
    <dfn>"chrono"</dfn> meaning <dfn>time</dfn>) as its period of oscillation does depend on
    the size of the swing. In 1673, while in Paris on an invitation from one of the ministers
    of the French king Louis XIV, in a more voluminous book <dfn>"Horologium
    Oscillatorium"</dfn> he published a solution to that problem by finding a curve tracing
    which an oscillating point has a period truly independent of the swing size - even for
    large initial angles. Since Newton's <dfn>"Principia"</dfn> and calculus were not to be
    available for another 14 years (1687), Huygens relied on his personal insight and geometric
    constructions for the proof.
    </p>

    <p>
    Such a curve is called a <dfn>tautochrone</dfn> from the Greek <dfn>"tauto"</dfn> meaning
    <dfn>same</dfn>. It turned out that in a uniform gravitational field a tautochrone is a
    <dfn>cycloid</dfn>. A cycloid is a two-dimensional curve traced by a point on a circumference
    of a circle rolling along a stationary straight line without slipping. Further, no matter
    where a material point is initially placed on a properly positioned cycloid (horns up) it
    will always reach the equilibrium point \(O\) in equal amounts of time.
    </p>

    <p>
    Based on the new find Huygens devised a different pendulum. Instead of using a rigid rod he
    suspended a point mass at the end of a flexible thread whose swings he limited by the
    semicycloidal cheeks. Finding the exact shape of these cheeks - a non-trivial task at
    the time - was yet another discovery made by Huygens. The essence of this discovery is that
    the evolute of a given cycloid is an equal but shifted cycloid (an evolute is the locus of
    all the centers of curvature of a given curve).
    </p>

    <p>
    At this point Huygens was assured that while the swinging thread hugs these cheeks the
    point mass has no choice but to trace a cycloid (he even went as far as devising a few
    practical methods of constructing a cycloidal curve). As such we can say that a cycloidal
    pendulum is isochronous.
    </p>

    <p>
    I will remark in passing that with calculus we can find the parametric equation of
    a tautochrone by imposing a requirement that the restoring force \(mg\sin(\theta)\)
    must be linearly proportional to the length of the path traveled by the point mass
    along the curve.
    </p>

    <p>
    However brilliant Huygens' theoretical discovery was unfortunately it did not work as
    well in practice. For large swings the flexible thread had so much contact with the
    curbing cheeks that it resulted in a lot of friction which in turn led to a rather rapid
    energy loss. For small swings the actual contact of the flexible thread with the required
    trajectory enforcing cheeks was estimated to be just north of one millimeter - not enough
    to exercise the full benefits of the cycloidal path (A. L. Rawlings, <dfn>The Science of
    Clocks and Watches</dfn>). There were purely technological difficulties as well - at the
    time it was challenging to manufacture the curbing cheeks in a precise cycloidal shape.
    Rigid rod pendulums coupled with the escapement mechanism took the center stage in clock
    manufacturing.

    The book <dfn>"Horologium Oscillatorium"</dfn> is highly recommended. If you do not now
    Latin, the book's original language, either learn it or seek a copy in a tongue you
    understand. Huygens' style of clarity and conciseness is contagious. I list the
    translations of the book into several languages at the end of the Hands chapter.

    <br><strong>More Pendulums</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Over the years many different types of pendula were invented, each one for a specific
    purpose. I will mention just a few: O Botafumeiro, military, Kater's, Foucault's,
    coupled, torsion, chaotic pendula and quantum pendulum, no less, first studied by
    Edward Condon (1928) though I am not very ... certain.
    </p>

    <p>
    After you master a simple mathematical pendulum you may want to take a look at the
    pendulums called <dfn>physical</dfn> or <dfn>compound</dfn>. In these pendulums the
    geometry of the oscillating mass can no longer be ignored - it takes the center stage.
    I will omit the deduction process and only show the end result of practical use. A
    period \(T\) of a small angle compound pendulum depends on its moment of inertia
    \(I_z\) about the pivot point \(Z\) (in our notation) and the distance \(d\) from
    the pendulum's center of mass to the pivot point:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac {I_z}{mgd}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Use the Stiener-Huygens (parallel axis) theorem to calculate \(I_z\).
    </p>

    <p>
    For compound pendulums the geometric parameter of interest to us will be packed into
    \(I_z\) and \(d\) and the above equation will have to be solved anew for each particular
    case. Here are a few simple practical ones. All the bodies below are absolutely rigid,
    solid, thin and uniform. Keep in mind that in comparison with the simple pendulum their
    characteristic sizes come out quite large and will require more vertical and horizontal
    clearance:

    <dfn>A Rod</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    A rod of length \(l\) and mass \(m\) swinging about a point at one of its extremities.
    The distance \(d = 0.5l\) and the rod's moment of inertia about \(Z\) is:
    </p>

$$I_z = \frac {ml^2}{12} + m \frac {l^2}{4} = \frac {ml^2}{3}$$

    <p>
    From (28) we get:
    </p>

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac {2ml^2}{3mgl}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac {2l}{3g}}$$

    <p>
    Solve it for \(l\):
    </p>

$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{l(T) = \frac {3gT^2}{8\pi^2}}$$

    <p>
    For a 2-second NYC, NY, pendulum for \(l\) we get a rough estimate of \(148.98 \; cm\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>A Hoop</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    A hoop of radius \(r\) and mass \(m\) swinging about a point on its circumference. The
    distance \(d = r\) and the hoop's moment of inertia about \(Z\) is:
    </p>

$$I_z = mr^2 + mr^2 = 2mr^2$$

    <p>
    From (28) we get:
    </p>

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac {2mr^2}{mgr}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac {2r}{g}}$$

    <p>
    Solve it for \(r\):
    </p>

$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{r(T) = \frac {gT^2}{8\pi^2}}$$

    <p>
    For a 2-second pendulum for \(r\) we get a rough estimate of \(49.66 \; cm\). The hoop's
    characteristic size then is about one meter.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>A Disk</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    A disk of radius \(r\) and mass \(m\) swinging about a point on its circumference. The
    distance \(d = r\) and the moment of inertia of a disk about \(Z\) is:
    </p>

$$I_z = \frac {mr^2}{2} + mr^2 = \frac {3mr^2}{2}$$

    <p>
    From (28) we get:
    </p>

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac {3mr^2}{2mgr}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac {3r}{2g}}$$

    <p>
    Solve it for \(r\):
    </p>

$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{r(T) = \frac {gT^2}{6\pi^2}}$$

    <p>
    For a 2-second pendulum for \(r\) we get a rough estimate of \(66.21 \; cm\). In
    comparison with a hoop we need more disk for the same period.

    <br><dfn>A Triangular Boundary</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Three rods each having the length \(l\) and mass \(m\) form a rigid equilateral triangle
    which is swinging about one of its vertexes.  The moment of inertia of the perimeter of
    the equilateral triangle (the boundary only) about \(Z\) is:
    </p>

$$I_z = 2 \times \frac {ml^2}{3} + \frac {ml^2}{12} + m \frac {3l^2}{4} = \frac {3ml^2}{2}$$

    <p>
    To find the location of the center of mass of a triangular boundary known as Spieker point
    or Spieker center we replace the massive rods with the equivalent point masses located at
    the rod's centers. We construct a medial triangle using these mid points. The intersection
    of the inner angles' bisectors of the medial triangle locates the center of mass. In our
    case of an equilateral triangle we get:
    </p>

$$d = \frac {2}{3} \frac {\sqrt{3}}{2} l = \frac {\sqrt{3}}{3}l$$

    <p>
    From (28) we get:
    </p>

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac {3ml^2}{2 (3m)g} \frac {3}{\sqrt{3}l}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac {\sqrt{3}l}{2g}}$$

    <p>
    Solve it for \(l\):
    </p>

$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{l(T) = \frac {gT^2}{2\sqrt{3}\pi^2}}$$

    <p>
    For a 2-second pendulum for \(l\) we get a rough estimate of \(114.68 \; cm\).
