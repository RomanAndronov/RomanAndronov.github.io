    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Design Patterns</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    The legend has it that as a coherent concept design patterns were first
    introduced by a building architect - Christopher Alexander. In our field
    of expertise a design pattern can be defined as a description of a generic
    solution of a software design problem that repeats itself over and over
    <dfn>regardless of area of application</dfn>. A design pattern is not all
    code. It is a concept that results or materializes in code. It has its
    fair share of similarity with a recipe.
    </p>

    <p>
    Design patterns are programming language and operating system independent.
    In this day and age they must be coded in afresh. If a particular pattern
    gains enough popularity then programming languages may absorb it into their
    core though programmers will have to write a certain amount of code to fully
    exercise it.
    </p>

    <p>
    Design patterns are traditionally divided into three logical categories
    - creational, structural and behavioral. Creational patterns deal with
    how variables are created. Structural patterns deal with how data
    types and variables are combined to form new types and structures.
    Behavioral patterns deal with who does what in a group of data types and
    how their variables communicate with each other.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition to these categories we will look at an extra one - encapsulation
    patterns. This category is introduced first because it will be used in
    patterns throughout the rest of the text.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here we interpret encapsulation as two related concepts. As the first
    concept encapsulation means hiding information. As the second concept 
    encapsulation means binding data and functions together <dfn>while</dfn>
    hiding information.
    </p>

    <p>
    Both concepts are the pivoting point of the pattern-based implementations
    of a custom data type in C. The emphasis of these implementations is on the
    mechanics of constructing a custom data type with C primitives only -
    <span id="inlncode">int</span>s, <span id="inlncode">char</span>s and the
    like.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the chapters dedicated to composition and aggregation we will learn how
    to create custom encapsulated data types that themselves contain custom
    encapsulated data types which contain custom encapsulated data types which
    contain ...
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Terminology</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>Author</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    is an individual who implements a certain source code arrangement including
    the one that can be qualified as a design pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Users, End Users</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    are individuals who put to work a product created by authors. Quite often
    an author and a user are the same individual.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Library, Component, Package</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    is a logically and physically atomic unit of work produced by authors (and
    users). Usually, but not necessarily, it consists of one header file and
    one shared library per entity.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>World, Wild</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    is everything and anything else that is not a library, component or package.
    </p>

    <p>
    Per distinct unit of software (project) component and world are the
    compliments of each other. In set theory notation, if
    <span id="inlncode">S</span> is a (universal) set of all software,
    <span id="inlncode">W</span> is a world set and
    <span id="inlncode">L</span> is a library set, then: 
    </p>

$$L^{c} = W = S \; \backslash \; L$$

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Public (adj.)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    is an entity that is visible to the world and, by its virtue, to the
    component (library).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Private</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    is an entity visible only within the boundaries of its component (library)
    and completely invisible to the world.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Interface</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    is a collection of C functions that reveals to the world only
    <dfn>what</dfn> can be done with the underlying data type and nothing else. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Interfaces are abstract. They are minimal and complete. They could be either
    public or private.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Implementation</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    is everything that makes an entity usable and operational excluding its
    interface. It is <dfn>how</dfn> the advertisement broadcast by
    interfaces' <dfn>what</dfn> is honored materially.
    </p>

    <p>
    If interfaces unite, eliminate and simplify then implementations do the
    opposite. It takes both to create a usable software entity.
    </p>

    <p>
    Calling interfaces abstract may seem a little strange. After all,
    from a raw computer science perspective and according to its definition an
    interface is a collection of C functions each of which has a very concrete
    and very specific prototype and the total number of these functions is also
    very concrete - both properties must be set at keyboard time so that both
    are known at compile time. What gives?
    </p>

    <p>
    When we call interfaces abstract we apply the concept of abstraction
    to the absence of the underlying implementation details. Take the various
    I/O mechanism types - disk files, sockets, message queues and pipes, to
    name just a few.
    </p>

    <p>
    To, for example, open an I/O channel message queue-based implementations may
    use <span id="inlncode">msgget()</span>, disk file-based implementations may
    use either the section two <span id="inlncode">open()</span> or its close
    cousin <span id="inlncode">fopen()</span>, socket-based implementations may
    use either <span id="inlncode">accept()</span> or
    <span id="inlncode">connect()</span> and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, if I/O interface offers just one common public function,
    <span id="inlncode">open()</span>, for example, then its users are shielded
    from and are not exposed to all of these irrelevant in the large scope
    details and in that context we call interfaces "abstract".
    </p>

    <p>
    Borrowing the "general" or "closed form" concept from mathematics we can
    say that <span id="inlncode">open()</span> is a closed form solution for
    the "open various types of I/O channels" problem.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Whole</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    is a custom C data type used to solve a particular problem at hand.
    Usually, but not necessarily, public. A whole consists of or has parts.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Part</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    is a (custom) C data type that belongs to a whole as its member - as a C
    member variable of a structure or a union. Usually, but not necessarily,
    a part is private (no pun intended).
    </p>

    <p>
    In the definitions above the words <dfn>consists of, has, belongs
    to</dfn>, etc. are interpreted very narrowly as in <dfn>members of a C
    structure (union)</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this text we will distinguish three types of membership. If a part has to
    be permanently embedded in a whole - created in the same memory block - then
    we will call it an <dfn>integral</dfn> part. By its definition a life time of
    an integral part equals to that of its whole.
    </p>

    <p>
    If a part does <dfn>not</dfn> have to be permanently embedded in a whole but
    its life time has to be equal to that of its whole nonetheless then we will
    call it a <dfn>non-integral owned</dfn> part. "Owned" means that a whole
    still has to manage this part's life cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
    If a part does not have to be permanently embedded in a whole and its life
    time is of no consequence to a whole then we will call it a
    <dfn>non-integral rented</dfn> part. "Rented" means that a whole completely
    ignores the fact that a pointer to some variable is embedded into its
    definition. See Composition and the related chapters for an in-depth discussion.
    </p>

    <p>
    A whole can and usually does employ any combination of membership types.
    A part, on the other hand, should participate in one type of membership only.
    It should only be an integral or a non-integral owned or a non-integral
    rented. Requirements determine which type of ownership is appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example. An airplane's fuselage, wings and tail should be non-integral
    rented parts in an aircraft design software because its users would add and
    remove these parts at will over and over - until they are happy with a final
    product. In a flight simulation software, however, same parts should be
    either integral or non-integral owned as its users would want to fly a fully
    assembled plane without modifying it.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Ancestor</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    is an existing C data type used as a base for an extension of its functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Descendant</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    is a new (custom) C data type that extends its ancestor's functionality. A
    descendant may also become an ancestor if its functionality is extended.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Compile, Recompile</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    means convert <span id="inlncode">.[hc]</span> files into
    <span id="inlncode">.o</span> files with a C compiler.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Link, Relink</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    for applications: convert <span id="inlncode">.o</span> files into an
    executable image with a C link editor, record any explicit dependencies on
    required libraries, if any.
    </p>

    <p>
    for libraries: convert <span id="inlncode">.o</span> files
    into a shared (dynamic) library with a C link editor, recording any implicit
    dependencies on other (shared) libraries, if any (we will use only shared
    libraries in this text).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Build, Rebuild</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    means first compile then link.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>Build Lines</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    is a collective term for what in practice makes up the bulk of make files.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>The Principle of Least Sum</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    The most popular activity of a long term software project maintenance is
    keeping up with the never ending stream of requirements changes. We can
    reduce the latter activity to three distinct operations: modification and
    removal of existing and addition of new features. In an abbreviated form
    we will collectively call these activities ARM for Add, Remove and Modify.
    ARMing software's features then translates directly into ARMing
    Implementation (encapsulation), Creation, Structure, and Behavior, ICSB
    for short, of the relevant data types. It, in turn, means that:
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>some combination of data type's ICSB <dfn>must</dfn> be modified</li>
     <li>data type's build lines <dfn>may have</dfn> to be modified</li>
     <li>the corresponding packaging (library) <dfn>has</dfn> to be rebuilt</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Further, since external software depends (explicitly or not) on a data type's
    ICSB, then ARMing that ICSB <dfn>may</dfn> affect this external software in
    some way because its:
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>source code <dfn>may</dfn> have to be modified</li>
     <li>build lines <dfn>may</dfn> have to be modified</li>
     <li>binaries <dfn>may</dfn> have to be rebuilt</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The items in the lists above that have to be acted upon are not interesting
    because they must be carried out and can not be avoided. Consequently, the
    items that may be acted upon become interesting and if, for brevity sake, we
    agree to call ARMing ICSB <dfn>refactoring</dfn>, then a question of interest
    is:
    </p>

    <p class="center">
    <dfn>how does component's refactoring affect its external dependencies?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    In the branch of theoretical physics called classical mechanics there is
    the Principle of Least Action. Its Hamiltonian, and most used, formulation
    states that the first variation of the integral of a Lagrangian of a system
    over time vanishes. Using the mathematical apparatus of the calculus of
    variations the principle may be stated as follows:
    </p>

$$\delta \int_{t_1}^{t_2}L(q(t), \dot q(t)) dt = 0$$

    <p>
    Here \(L\) is the system's Lagrangian, the difference between the kinetic and
    the potential energies, \(q(t)\) is a complete set of generalized independent
    coordinates whose number is determined by the number of the system's degrees
    of freedom - the number of ways an independent motion in a system can occur,
    and \(\dot q(t) = \frac {dq}{dt}\) is a set of the corresponding velocities
    - first derivatives of coordinates over time. The integral itself is called
    "action".
    </p>

    <p>
    In a more plain and somewhat simplified English the above principle means
    that out of all the possible trajectories that a system can take during motion
    between times \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) the actual or the true ones will be those
    for which the action is least or stationary.
    </p>

    <p>
    C programming may not be as glorious as theoretical physics but here,
    similarly, I propose the Principle of Least Sum:
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>out of all the possible source code arrangements that one should be
    chosen which minimizes the sum total of all the files that must be changed
    in order to ARM ICSB:</dfn>
    </p>

$$\sum_i f_i^{\Delta} = min$$

    <p>
    Here \(\Delta\) represents a change, \(f_i^{\Delta}\) represents a file that
    must be changed in order to accommodate the requirement(s) change and the
    sum is called a <dfn>refactoring sum</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Within a single human-readable source code file the principle is applied to
    the language-specific constructs - functions, for example. Within functions
    the principle is applied to statements, within statements - to keywords and
    expressions, within expressions - to terms and operators, within terms - to
    variables and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    A similar to Principle of Least Action but different parallel may be drawn
    between the Principle of Least Sum and the concept of efficiency of a
    computer science (CS) algorithm which is captured in a
    \(O(g(n)), n \in N, n \to + \infty \) notation, where \(n\) is the number of
    items that a given CS algorithm must process.
    </p>

    <p>
    Between two CS algorithms performing the same task the one with the slowest
    growing \(g(n)\) when \(n \to +\infty \) is classified as <dfn>more
    efficient</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Regardless of how a given source code arrangement is qualified, patterned or
    non-patterned, it will react to refactoring in a certain way. To introduce a
    numeric characteristic to gauge or quantify the consequences of refactoring
    I suggest that the above sum is used.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us call the numeric value of a refactoring sum the <dfn>refactoring cost
    of a given source code arrangement</dfn> or just <dfn>the cost</dfn>. Let us
    call <dfn>cost analysis</dfn> the process of computation of the above cost.
    In the early chapters we will do this analysis together while in the later
    chapters you are encouraged to do it yourself even if an explicit request to
    do so is absent.
    </p>
 
    <p>
    Refactoring is a sweeping concept that absorbs everything from changing the
    value of a single bit in a mask to changing a behavior of a data type. To
    experience refactoring in its rudimentary manifestation observe the following
    code (in <span id="inlncode">cat.c</span>):
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern int
main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
	ssize_t		n;
	char		buf[ 1024 ];
	int		fd = open( "/path/to/a/file", O_RDONLY );

	while ( ( n = read( fd, buf, 1024 ) ) > 0 )
	{
		write( fileno( stdout ), buf, n );
	}

	close( fd );

	return 0;
}</p>

    <p>
    which works perfectly fine and does exactly what it is asked to do but carries
    the cost of \(3\) against "cat a different disk file" requirement.
    </p>

    <p>
    Proof: to copy a different disk file the following files must be changed:
    1) <span id="inlncode">cat.c</span>, 2) <span id="inlncode">cat.o</span>,
    3) <span id="inlncode">cat</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In contrast, the following implementation of the same task in
    <span id="inlncode">cat'.c</span>:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">	...

	int		fd = open( argv[ 1 ], O_RDONLY );

	...
</p>

    <p>
    carries the cost of \(0\) against the same requirement. As such,
    <span id="inlncode">cat'.c</span> is classified as having a lower refactoring
    cost than <span id="inlncode">cat.c</span> against the given requirement.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, <span id="inlncode">cat'.c</span> carries the cost of \(3\) against
    "copy output to an arbitrary disk file" requirement (prove it). Assume that
    <span id="inlncode">cat''.c</span> addresses that issue and carries the cost
    of \(0\) against that requirement. Still,
    <span id="inlncode">cat''.c</span> carries a non-zero cost against "use a
    different byte I/O mechanism" requirement as it can not be used to move bytes
    between hosts, for example, and the list of requirements that can be imposed
    on a given source code arrangement goes on.
    </p>

    <p>
    The patterns presented in this text attempt to minimize the refactoring costs
    of source code arrangements against specific requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Prerequisites</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Not much is needed to work through the code in this text. Modern IDEs and make
    files are not required but can be used, of course, if you wish. However, a bare
    minimum will do:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>a computing device</li>
    <li>an operating system</li>
    <li>a text editor</li>
    <li>an ANSI C Compiler/Linker</li>
    <li>a debugger, optional</li>
    <li>a command line prompt</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    My choices were:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>a laptop</li>
    <li>a 64-bit processor</li>
    <li>64-bit OpenSUSE Linux distribution</li>
    <li><span id="inlncode">vi</span></li>
    <li><span id="inlncode">gcc</span></li>
    <li><span id="inlncode">gdb</span></li>
    <li><span id="inlncode">xterm</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Code</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Each design pattern implementation is accompanied with:
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>full source code in its entirety (or a description of how to get it)</li>
     <li>compile command(s)</li>
     <li>link command(s)</li>
     <li>execution command(s)</li>
     <li>output, if any</li>
     <li>design cost analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    For obvious reasons the code will be minimal with virtually no error handling
    except where absolutely needed.
    </p>

    <p>
    While putting a pattern together we will start with a bare minimum also -
    just one function. It will quickly become evident that initially this is all
    that is needed. Later on, after the pattern's tiny framework is in place and
    functioning properly, you are encouraged to add more functions to it as you
    see fit.
    </p>

    <p>
    Lastly, I have no intention of keeping up with the quickly changing version
    numbers of compilers and operating systems. The only thing I can guarantee is
    that all the code presented in this book compiled without warnings at
    publishing time.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Final Observations</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    You can read the chapters in any order you wish. However, to derive the
    most benefit it would be most advantageous to read the encapsulation and
    creational chapters in order first since the ADT pattern, for example,
    is used throughout the rest of the text.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before you start typing consult your local documentation and find out how to:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>build an application that uses at least one library</li>
    <li>build a shared library, see below</li>
    <li>load a shared library at run time</li>
    <li>find an address of a symbol at run time</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    We will use only shared or dynamic libraries in this book and the following
    commands to build them:
    </p>

    <p id="cmdln">gcc -g -c -fPIC -I . libfoo.c
gcc -g -shared -o libfoo.so libfoo.o</p>

    <p>
    The first line above only compiles a position-independent code into an object
    file, <span id="inlncode">libfoo.o</span>. The second line takes that object
    file and packages it into a shared library, <span id="inlncode">libfoo.so</span>
    </p>

    <p>
    Shared libraries on Apple traditionally carry the <span id="inlncode">.dylib</span>
    extension. On Windows it is <span id="inlncode">.dll</span>. Find the specifics
    for your system.
    </p>

    <p>
    To build an application that uses a library we will use the following
    commands:
    </p>

    <p id="cmdln">gcc -g -c -I . app.c
gcc -g -L . -o app app.c -lfoo</p>

    <p>
    The first line above only compiles a source  file into an object file. The
    second line packages it into an application and records the fact that it has
    to load a certain library at start up. On UNIX/Linux you may have to set and
    export <span id="inlncode">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span> environment variable. Again,
    your compiler/linker flags may differ. Find the equivalents.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To load a library at run time UNIX/Linux uses
    <span id="inlncode">dlopen()</span>. On  Windows it is
    <span id="inlncode">LoadLibrary()</code>.
    </p>
 
    <p>
    To find a symbol's address at run time UNIX/Linux uses
    <span id="inlncode">dlsym()</span>. On Windows it is
    <span id="inlncode">GetProcAddress()</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>For UNIX/Linux Users
    </p>

    <p>
    <span id="inlncode">dlopen()/dlsym()</span> functions are first used in
    Factory chapter. Do a little bit of leg work prior. Read the man page. Vendors
    and distributions vary on minutia. For example, OpenSUSE insisted on the
    presence of <span id="inlncode">_GNU_SOURCE</span> symbol in order to recognize

gcc -g -shared -o libfoo.so libfoo.o -ldl</p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p id="cmdln">gcc -g -c -fPIC -I . libfoo.c
gcc -g -shared -o libfoo.so libfoo.o</p>
