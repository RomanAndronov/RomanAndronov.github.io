    <h1>Composition</h1>

    <p>
    In the previous chapters we have examined how Handle and ADT may be used to
    implement an encapsulated custom C data type which consists of primitive
    C data types only. In the upcoming chapters we will investigate how existing
    encapsulated custom C data types may be used to assemble a new, also
    encapsulated, custom C data type.
    </p>

    <p>
    We will distinguish three ways in which a whole - a new encapsulated
    custom C data type - may absorb its parts - previously constructed
    encapsulated custom C data types:
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>integral</li>
     <li>non-integral owned</li>
     <li>non-integral rented</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    An <dfn>integral</dfn> is a part that must be permanently embedded in a whole
    - created in the same block of memory. By its definition a life time of an
    integral part is equal to that of it containing whole.
    </p>

    <p>
    A <dfn>non-integral owned</dfn> is a part that does <dfn>not</dfn> have to be
    permanently embedded in a whole but its life time has to be equal to that of
    it containing whole nonetheless. In this context "owned" means that a whole
    still has to manage this part's life cycle by creating and deleting it.
    </p>

    <p>
    A <dfn>non-integral rented</dfn> is a part that does not have to be permanently
    embedded in it containing whole and its life time is of no consequence to that
    whole. In this context "rented" means that a whole completely ignores the fact
    that a pointer to some variable is a (permanent) part of its definition.
    </p>

    <p>
    A whole can and usually does employ any combination of the above membership
    types. A part, on the other hand, should participate in one type of membership
    only. Concrete requirements at hand determine the appropriate membership type.
    </p>
