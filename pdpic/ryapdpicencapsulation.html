    <h1>Encapsulation Patterns</h1>

    <p>
    In this text encapsulation is interpreted as two related concepts. As the
    first concept encapsulation means hiding information. As the second concept
    encapsulation means binding data and functions together while hiding
    information.
    </p>

    <p>
    Both concepts are the pivoting point of the pattern-based implementations
    of a custom data type in C. The emphasis of these implementations is on the
    mechanics of constructing a custom data type with C primitives only -
    <span id="inlncode">int</span>s, <span id="inlncode">char</span>s and the
    like.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Motivation</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Since its inception in the mid 1940s the entity we now call "software"
    meaning "source code" or, even simpler, just "code" underwent quite a
    remarkable transformation. From flipping physical switches to the zeros
    and ones of machine code to the <span id="inlncode">mov</span> and
    <span id="inlncode">bne</span> mnemonics of the assembly language to a more
    easily decipherable though sometimes still rather mysterious algebraic
    expressions of C.
    </p>

    <p>
    We may argue that the above evolution was driven in part by the desire of
    programmers to deal with the omnipresent necessity of change in a graceful
    way. We may further conjecture that during this evolution it became evident
    that software, in general, possesses a certain type of duality. On the one
    hand, software has some number of parts that are least likely to change over
    time. On the other hand, it has another set of parts that are more likely
    to change as time goes by. Both types of parts must somehow coexist. 
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, it is likely that the way a comparison instruction is encoded
    may change even within the same line of processor types. Wouldn't it be
    convenient to have a stand in for it that wouldn't change? A
    <span id="inlncode">cmp</span> perhaps? May be then it would be possible
    to use the same code on the same hardware without much revision?
    </p>

    <p>
    Within the processors of completely different types a comparison operation
    name, the names of registers it uses and its overall format is likely to be
    different. Wouldn't it be convenient to have one stand in for it that will
    not change? An <span id="inlncode">if</span> perhaps? May be then it would
    be possible to use the same code on different types of hardware without
    much revision?
    </p>

    <p>
    The number and placement of and the arguments to <span id="inlncode">if</span>
    statements may change but a logical name for this collection of statements
    will likely stay the same - thus a function is born.
    </p>

    <p>
    Functions will come and go but the logical name for their collection and the
    physical envelope containing them will likely stay the same - thus a library
    comes to be.
    </p>

    <p>
    Libraries and applications will come and go but their logical name and what
    they essentially do will remain the same - thus a project is conceived. And
    so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Key Idea</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us now call the part of software that is most likely to change over time
    its <dfn>implementation</dfn> and let us call the part that is least likely
    to change over time its <dfn>interface</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    From the practical observation of software's duality and the programmer's
    grapevine we are now ready to put forward the following idea:
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>- separate the interface from the underlying implementation by making
    the former public and the latter private</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>- allow users to manipulate the implementation only via its
    interface</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us now switch from the previously somewhat vague entity we call "software"
    to a more concrete concept of a single custom C data type, keeping in mind
    the fact that to some extent and in the context of this category of design
    patterns "software" boils down to a collection of "custom C data types".
    </p>

    <p>
    As such, we reason that an interface - a collection of public functions that
    manipulate a given data type - is less likely to change while implementation
    - everything else that makes this data type usable - is more likely to change.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Handle and the ADT patterns are two similar but different implementations
    of the suggested above separation of labor between the two portions of a
    data type. The name "Handle" should be self-explanatory. The abbreviation
    "ADT" stands for "Abstract Data Type".
    </p>

    <p>
    Both patterns:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) Establish a logical border between the data type's interface and its
    implementation by dividing it into two distinct portions
    </p>

    <p>
    2) Make the data type's interface public
    </p>

    <p>
    3) Make the data type's implementation private
    </p>

    <p>
    4) Allow the variables of the corresponding type to be manipulated only via
    this type's interface
    </p>

    <p>
    The difference between the two patterns will become evident soon enough but
    for now we shall highlight the fact that while Handle just hides information,
    ADT, in addition, combines its data and public functions into one inseparable
    whole.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Mechanics</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    The encapsulation patterns are a standard-conforming combination of the C
    language-specific and language-independent features. The Handle pattern
    relies on the way C treats incomplete data types. The ADT pattern relies on
    the way the C Standard governs the placement of members within a structure.
    </p>

    <p>
    Both patterns package their final solution into a shared library.
    </p>

    <p>
    To control the life cycle of variables of their types both patterns
    provide four public pair-wise complimentary functions -
    <span id="inlncode">typeNew()</span> and <span id="inlncode">typeDelete()</span>,
    the first pair, and <span id="inlncode">typeConstruct()</span> and
    <span id="inlncode">typeDestruct()</span>, the second pair.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span id="inlncode">typeNew()</span>, and its complement
    <span id="inlncode">typeDelete()</span>, operate in two stages. In the first
    stage they allocate/free raw bytes from the default dynamic memory store
    available to C programs - heap (or malloc arena). In the second stage they
    initialize/destroy the allocated memory block by invoking the corresponding
    complementary functions of the second pair before returning. In the upcoming
    chapters we will look at the implementation of these functions in great detail.
    This is just a highlight:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern type_t*
typeNew()
{
	size_t		bytesneeded = typeSizeOf();

	void*		rawmemory = calloc( bytesneeded, sizeof( char ) );

	type_t*		v = typeConstruct( rawmemory );

	return v;
}

extern void
typeDelete( type_t** v )
{
	typeDestruct( *v );

	free( *v );

	*v = ( type_t* )NULL;
}</p>

    <p>
    Here <span id="inlncode">typeSizeOf()</span> is a public function that
    returns the raw memory requirements for a variable of a given type.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since <span id="inlncode">typeNew()</span> initializes a variable prior to
    returning it to the user there is no need to call
    <span id="inlncode">typeConstruct()</span> separately. Further, if a variable
    was created with <span id="inlncode">typeNew()</span> then it should be
    disposed of with <span id="inlncode">typeDelete()</span>, in which case a
    separate call to <span id="inlncode">typeDestruct()</span> is not needed also:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">type_t*		v = typeNew();

typeDoSomething( v );

typeDelete( &v );

/*
    Now v == ( type_t* )NULL
 */</p>

    <p>
    Creating variables at locations whose addresses can not be specified explicitly
    (on the heap) should accommodate a wide range of scenarios. However, with the
    complimentary functions of the second pair variables of encapsulated data types
    can be brought to life at arbitrary (possibly heap) addresses.
    <span id="inlncode">typeConstruct()</span>, and its complement
    <span id="inlncode">typeDestruct()</span>, are only concerned with turning
    the passed in memory block into either a fully functional variable,
    <span id="inlncode">typeConstruct()</span>, or a meaningless jungle of
    zeros and ones, <span id="inlncode">typeDestruct()</span>:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern type_t*		typeConstruct( void* );
extern void		typeDestruct( type_t* );</p>

    <p>
    Consequently, if a variable was animated or initialized - not created - at
    an arbitrary address via <span id="inlncode">typeConstruct()</span> it should
    be destructed - not deleted - with <span id="inlncode">typeDestruct()</span>:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">void*		rawmem = fromCustomMemory( typeSizeOf() );
type_t*		v = typeConstruct( rawmem );

typeDoSomething( v );

typeDestruct( v );

/*
   v is not NULL, just destructed.
 */</p>

    <p>
    <strong>Consequences</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In the corresponding chapters we will examine the overall cost of each pattern
    separately and in great detail. Here we will address a more fundamental issue
    - encapsulation patterns hide information that at times must be exposed. In
    that light, when it comes to actual manipulation of variables of encapsulated
    data types is it possible to:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) Perform pointer arithmetic on them?<br>
    2) Create a C array of them?<br>
    3) Copy them?<br>
    4) Compare them?<br>
    5) Create a composite encapsulated data type?<br>
    6) Write/read them to/from socket or disk file?<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    1) Encapsulated data types are either fully incomplete (Handle) or
    partially complete (ADT). In any case they are not fully complete as far
    as C compiler working on the user code is concerned. The traditional
    data type-based C pointer arithmetic <dfn>for end users</dfn> is not possible.
    Internally it can still be done.
    </p>

    <p>
    2) For the same reasons if a C array of variables of encapsulated types is
    needed then the only type of C array that can be created is an array of pointers
    (to variables of encapsulated data types).
    </p>

    <p>
    3) Copying (duplicating, cloning) variables of encapsulated data types can be
    done via its public interface. Internally the usual C rules of structure/union
    copying still apply.
    </p>

    <p>
    4) Same as above.
    </p>

    <p>
    5) A composite encapsulated data type is an encapsulated type built with
    previously implemented encapsulated types. See Composition and
    Aggregation chapters for implementation details.
    </p>

    <p>
    6) In descending order of generality and/or elegance some of the choices are:
    </p>

    <p>
    6.1) Define a public interface to convert a variable of an encapsulated data
    type into a C array of <span id="inlncode">unsigned char</span> bytes and,
    conversely, a C array of <span id="inlncode">unsigned char</span> bytes back
    into a variable of an encapsulated data type:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern unsigned char*		typeToBytes( type_t*, size_t* );
extern type_t*			typeFromBytes( unsigned char*, size_t );</p>

    <p>
    Both functions will likely be symmetrical - know how the other one works. If
    an array of bytes processed by <span id="inlncode">ToBytes()</span> is fed
    into <span id="inlncode">FromBytes()</span> then the resulting variable
    should be an exact copy of its original.
    </p>

    <p>
    6.2) Use inversion: define a public interface that takes an
    <span id="inlncode">int</span> file descriptor as an argument, for example,
    and uses it internally with <span id="inlncode">read()/write()</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
    6.3) Define a public function that returns a pointer to an internal variable
    of a primitive C data type.
    </p>
