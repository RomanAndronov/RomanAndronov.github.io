    <h1>Creational Patterns</h1>

    <p>
    The patterns that we have studied in the previous chapters, Handle and ADT,
    describe how encapsulated custom C data types may be implemented and what
    the costs and consequences such implementations carry and inflict on the
    surrounding software landscape.
    </p>

    <p>
    The focus of the above patterns is very narrow - one custom data type
    wrapped into the mechanics of hiding information which is subject to variance
    the most.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this chapter we will take the material developed previously further by
    concerning ourselves with situations when, for all practical purposes, the
    number of custom C data types grows without upper bound.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Factory pattern may be used to create variables of encapsulated custom
    C data types that have a multitude of similar but different implementations
    attached to a single interface. Factory allows such variables to be created
    without the explicit dependency on concrete underlying custom data types.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Abstract Factory pattern may be used to create variables of encapsulated
    data types that belong to a <dfn>family</dfn> of types - a logical whole that
    has a certain common underlying idea or a unifying theme. Abstract Factory
    allows such variables to be created without the explicit dependency on
    concrete implementation data types.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Builder pattern may be used to create variables of encapsulated data types
    that have common parts. Builder captures, centralizes and hides the mechanics
    of a uniform process used to assemble such parts into different wholes.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Prototype pattern may be used to create new variables by cloning the
    existing ones.
    </p>

    <p>
    Singleton is a restrictive pattern that may be used to create the one and the
    only instance of a variable of a given encapsulated data type.
