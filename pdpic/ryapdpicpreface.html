    <h1>Preface</h1>

    <p><strong>What This Book Is</strong></p>

    <p>
    A down to earth look at the practice of putting medium to large scale
    commercial software together where traditional C problems are solved in a
    somewhat less traditional C way conforming to the traditional C spirit
    nonetheless.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here we will thoroughly examine the mechanics of putting a design pattern
    together in terms of a chosen model whose underlying and irrelevant
    implementation details we will mostly ignore. Once a pattern is in place and
    well understood we will deduce the consequences inflicted by this pattern's
    implementation on the surroundings.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What This Book Is Not</strong></p>

    <p>
    <ul>
     <li>an academic coverage of computer science 101</li>
     <li>an exhaustive list of all the known design patterns</li>
     <li>an emulation of object-oriented functionality in C</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>

    <p>
    A neutral exploration of how some number of design patterns can be implemented
    in C and what the consequences of these implementations are.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>

    <p>
    The individuals whose primary programming chores include, in no particular
    order, starting a new project from the ground up, gathering, analyzing and
    combing through requirements, establishing the scope of technical problems,
    architecting their solutions by partitioning them into collections of
    large number of small and sharp libraries and applications that work well
    together, designing project's directory structure, hand-writing the C code
    within the boundaries of the established framework, writing make files and
    build scripts, integrating source code control systems, debugging, testing,
    configuring, delivering and installing software into production environment
    and supporting it. Big picture. Broad strokes.
    </p>
 
    <p><strong>Full Disclaimer</strong></p>

    <p>
    Not being a raw academic text it is no doubt subjective to some degree.
    As much as I could, however, I have tried to remove my personal self from
    the material by omitting any personal opinions, judgements and qualifications.
    All the problems and their solutions in this text are framed in a language
    that avoids such subjectivity inviting words like <dfn>better, worse, simpler,
    harder, easier, improve</dfn> and their synonyms.
    </p>

    <p>
    I do not claim to have invented or discovered anything. A small number of
    tiny technical constructs presented in the upcoming chapters are just a
    logical extension of a given problem.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Appearance</strong></p>

    <p>
    This is a sample text (sans-serif).<br>
    <p><a name="">This is a sample link.</a><p>
    <p id="srccode">This is a sample C code, existing (mono space).
<strong>This is a sample C code, new (mono space, strong).</strong></p>
    <p id="cmdln">This is a sample command line (mono space bold).
<span class="italic">This is a sample command line output (mono space italic).</span></p>

    <p><strong>Chapters' Format</strong></p>

    <p>
    All the design pattern chapters have the following sections:
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>a description of when a pattern can be used</li>
     <li>a sample problem</li>
     <li>a sample solution</li>
     <li>a list of consequences that capture the cost of a pattern</li>
     <li>optional exercises</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The chapters are flat - one page per. The end of each chapter is designated
    by a black square used in mathematics to designate the end of a proof:
    \(\blacksquare\).
    </p>

    <p><strong>Navigation</strong></p>

    <p>
    The table of contents is a list of links to chapters which have navigational
    links at the top and at the bottom of the page. The links "top" and "bottom"
    scroll to the very beginning and the very end of each page. The links "prev"
    and "next" navigate to the previous and the next chapters correspondingly.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Scripts</strong></p>

    <p>
    JavaScript is used only to populate the table of contents for each page
    and to render the relevant mathematical content.
    </p>

    <p>
