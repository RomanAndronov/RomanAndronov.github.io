    <h1>Integral Parts</h1>

    <p>
    An integral is a part that is permanently embedded in its whole. An integral
    part's life time is equal to that of it containing whole. A whole and all of
    its integral parts exist in one contiguous memory block. They are created,
    constructed, destructed and deleted as one and at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
    An integral part may be implemented as a Handle or as an ADT. A whole
    containing such integral parts can also be implemented as a Handle or as an
    ADT. However, because we will use ADTs exclusively in the rest of this text
    we will only look at the integral parts that are ADTs. You are encouraged to
    experiment with Handles yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
    The integral parts consequences:
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>The whole and its integral parts remain encapsulated</li>

     <li>All the seed information required to create all the integral parts has
    to be passed to the whole's <span id="inlncode">New()</span> and
    <span id="inlncode">Construct()</span> functions</li>

     <li>Integral part(s) require more maintenance than non-integral parts for
    the same level of functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Commentary</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    An ADT whole and all of its integral ADT parts should be placed in one
    contiguous memory block. For ADT mechanism to work a whole has to be placed
    in this memory block first. All the integral parts should be placed in a
    non-overlapping sequence at memory addresses that follow the address of the
    whole. If a given processor architecture requires a proper alignment then
    the parts should be placed at the appropriate addresses, see below.
    </p>

    <p>
    An ADT implementation as a C structure guarantees the presence of at least
    one pointer to a function in it as the first member. If all the integral
    parts of an encapsulated whole are exclusively ADTs it may be argued that
    there <dfn>may</dfn> be no need for manual alignment - placing ADTs one
    after another in a given memory block <dfn>may</dfn> work because several
    function pointers as first members of a C structure are a strong alignment
    requirement as is and it <dfn>may</dfn> provide ample room and proper
    alignment for the consecutive ADTs.
    </p>

    <p>
    If the above statement is not true and manual alignment of parts can not be
    avoided then the reasoning for one practical way to proceed runs as
    follows.
    </p>

    <p>
    We observe that a given C compiler possesses all the alignment knowledge
    needed to assemble fully functional code for a given operating system
    and for the given processor type. When such compiler builds and sizes a
    C structure it has to consider one of the requirements of the host programming
    language that:
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>any complete data type - whether native or custom - may be used in a C
    array which may not have unused space - holes - in between its elements</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    From the above observation we infer that after a C compiler is done with a
    C structure its size:
    </p>

    <p>
    - is minimal in order to not waste space
    </p>

    <p>
    - accommodates the placement of structure's members at such addresses that a
    given processor can read from and write to any of them
    <dfn>in any structure</dfn> - regardless of this structure's position within
    the array
    </p>

    <p>
    It follows then that the above behavior may be used to build up an array-like
    formation of integral parts within the memory block associated with the whole.
    The C structure that is placed first - a whole - does not need to be aligned
    manually since <span id="inlncode">calloc()</span> guarantees to always return
    a properly aligned address. For brevity let us call this structure "current".
    </p>

    <p>
    The first integral part that follows this "current" structure must be aligned
    manually. Let us call that structure "next". To properly align the "next"
    structure relative to the "current" one we shall adjust the logical size of
    the "current" structure to be an exact "just greater" multiple of the size of
    the "next" one.
    </p>

    <p>
    The above size adjustment is done entirely at run time by the
    <span id="inlncode">typeSizeOf()</span> function associated with the "current"
    structure and is thus purely logical - not physical. Artificially sized that
    way the "current/next" pair of structures simulates a C array of "next"
    structures and should always work regardless of compiler, operating system and
    processor types.
    </p>

    <p>
    For a hypothetical example let us assume that the "current" structure is
    \(20\) bytes long and that the "next" structure is \(8\) bytes long. We
    logically inflate the size of the "current" structure at run time to look
    like it is \(8\times 3 = 24\) bytes long. We then place the \(8\)-byte
    structure right after the "\(24\)-byte structure". This placement emulates a
    C array of four \(8\)-byte elements. The first three elements are fake and
    in sum they are large enough to accommodate the "current" structure in its
    entirety. The next element - number four - is somewhat real:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/chlnk.png" class="center">

    <p>
    It should be understood that even though we refer to the above structures as
    elements of C arrays in reality these structures will not be referenced as such.
    We use the C array notation here solely as a vehicle to justify and explain
    this alignment technique.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now that we know how to align two structures we can extend the described
    approach to an arbitrary number of them. To align the consequent integral part
    we make the just aligned "next" structure "current" and repeat the above
    process for that part. And the next. And the next. Until all the integral
    parts are aligned.
    </p>

    <p>
    The consequences of this alignment approach, which should pass the ANSI C
    muster, are:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) There is no need to write processor-specific alignment code.
    </p>

    <p>
    2) Because sizes of C structures are for the most part arbitrary and can not
    be controlled gaps in a memory block around the integral parts are all but
    inevitable. Exaggerating for demonstration purposes, placing a
    \(199\)-byte structure after a \(3\)-byte structure wastes \(196\) bytes.
    Switching these structures around, if at all possible, wastes \(2\) bytes.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is tempting to programmatically sort the integral parts on their size in
    descending order. However, the <span id="inlncode">SizeOf()</span> and
    <span id="inlncode">Construction()</span> functions for all the integral parts
    in this case must follow some uniform convention. We will shy away from
    this approach here.
    </p>

    <p>
    3) If an integral part is a variable of some type of Factory (see the
    creational patterns chapters) and there is a need to change this variable's
    type at run time - during the life of a whole - then, theoretically, the
    only safe way to do so is to replace the existing Factory-like variable with
    a new one of smaller or equal size to avoid the resizing of the memory block
    containing the whole.
    </p>

    <p>
    This, however, is not practical. So for all practical purposes if there is
    a need to change the type of an integral Factory-like variable at run time
    a whole containing it must be deleted from memory and a new one created.
    Consider the non-integral types of parts if this is an issue (see the next
    chapter).
    </p>

    <p>
    To deduce the formula for the size adjustment the following assumptions
    are taken to be true. The sizes of C structures are whole positive non-zero
    integers. Because of the way ADT works the C structure that implements it is
    guaranteed to have at least one member - a pointer to a function. Consequently,
    an ADT's smallest size is the size of one function pointer.
    </p>

    <p>
    By definition an integer \(M\) is a multiple of another integer
    \(I \neq 0\) if there exists yet another integer \(n\) such that:
    </p>

    $$M = n \times I$$

    <p>
    In number theoretic parlance we would say that \(M\) is divisible by \(I\)
    or that \(I\) divides \(M\), symbolically \(I | M\). Solving the above
    equation for \(n\) we obtain:
    </p>

    $$n = \frac {M}{I}$$

    <p>
    To translate this equation into the structure size adjustment we replace
    \(M\) with \(CurrSz\) and \(I\) with \(NextSz\) since the current size has
    to be made a "just greater" multiple of the next size:
    </p>

    $$n = \frac {CurrSz}{NextSz}$$

    <p>
    The above formula yields the number of times \(NextSz\) folds into \(CurrSz\),
    where \(CurrSz\) is the size of the "current" structure in need of logical
    adjustment and \(NextSz\) is the size of the "next" structure in need of
    alignment.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since the above arithmetic division translates conveniently into integer
    division in computing, to find the "just less" multiple \(jlm\) of \(NextSz\)
    with respect to \(CurrSz\) we multiply \(n\) by \(NextSz\):
    </p>

    $$jlm = n \times NextSz = \frac {CurrSz}{NextSz} \times NextSz$$

    <p>
    To find the "just greater" multiple \(jgm\) we add \(NextSz\) to \(jlm\):
    </p>

    $$jgm = jlm + NextSz = \frac {CurrSz}{NextSz} \times NextSz + NextSz$$

    <p>
    The reason a multiple in "just greater" must be "greater" is to make sure
    that structures do not overlap in memory at run time. The reason this
    multiple is "just" is to make sure that memory is not wasted beyond bare
    minimum.
    </p>

    <p>
    The above formula is implementable in C already. However, there is one
    optimization we can make. We observe that when \(CurrSz \equiv NextSz =
    K\)
    the gap between the adjacent structures is \(K\). To eliminate that gap we
    want the first term of the formula to vanish exactly when \(CurrSz \equiv
    NextSz\). We achieve this by subtracting one from \(CurrSz\) which is
    permissible because of the original assumptions - C structures are at least
    one byte long and for ADTs that number (size) will be more than one:
    </p>

    $$jgm = \frac{CurrSz - 1}{NextSz} \times NextSz + NextSz$$

    <p>
    To make the above symbols more readable we replace \(jgm\) with
    <span id="inlncode">logicalSize()</span> in C. The current address is the
    address of the current structure. The current size is its size. The next
    size is the size of the structure to be aligned:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern size_t
logicalSize( size_t currsz, size_t nextsz )
{
	size_t		logicalsz = ( ( currsz - 1 ) / nextsz ) * nextsz + nextsz;

	return logicalsz;
}

extern size_t
paddingAmount( size_t currsz, size_t nextsz )
{
	size_t		logicalsz = logicalSize( currsz, nextsz );

	size_t		pad = logicalsz - currsz;

	return pad;
}

extern void*
nextAddress( void* curradrs, size_t currsz, size_t nextsz )
{
	size_t			logicalsz = logicalSize( currsz, nextsz );

	void*			na = ( unsigned char* )curradrs + logicalsz;

	return na;
}</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Sample Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Make <span id="inlncode">str_t</span> ADT - book's title - a private integral
    part of <span id="inlncode">book_t</span> ADT.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Generic Solution Description</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    1) Implement a whole as suggested in ADT chapter. Add one pointer to an
    integral part for each and all such parts in the whole's implementation data
    type.
    </p>

    <p>
    2) Create the whole and all of its integral parts in one memory block at the
    same time. Place the whole in memory first. Place the integral parts after
    the whole in an order you wish, aligning these parts if needed.
    </p>

    <p>
    3) Modify the whole's <span id="inlncode">SizeOf(), Construct()</span>
    and <span id="inlncode">Destruct()</span> functions to size, construct and
    destruct all the integral parts absorbed by this whole.
    </p>

    <p>
    4) In the whole's <span id="inlncode">SizeOf()</span> function account for
    the size of the whole, the sizes of all of the integral parts and the size
    of the extra space needed to align each integral part, if any.
    </p>

    <p>
    5) In the whole's <span id="inlncode">Construct()</span> function place that
    whole in memory first. Place all the integral parts after the whole in a
    non-overlapping sequence aligning them if needed. Set the pointers to all of
    the integral parts and call a construction function for each part.
    </p>

    <p>
    6) In the whole's <span id="inlncode">Destruct()</span> function call a
    destruction function for each integral part first and then destruct the whole
    itself.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Sample Solution Implementation</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Borrow <span id="inlncode">str_t</span> ADT from the corresponding chapter
    by copying the <span id="inlncode">libstr.h</span> header file and the
    <span id="inlncode">libstr.so</span> shared library into the current
    working directory, for example.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Step 2</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Implement <span id="inlncode">book_t</span> ADT in a
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.[hc]</span> pair of files.
    </p>

    <p>
    We will give <span id="inlncode">book_t</span> the ability to print information
    about itself that is relevant to the current discussion.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.h:</span>
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;

typedef struct book
{
	void		( *info )( struct book* );
} book_t;

extern book_t*		bookNew( const char* );
extern void		bookDelete( book_t** );

extern book_t*		bookConstruct( void*, const char* );
extern void		bookDestruct( book_t* );

extern size_t		bookSizeOf();

extern void		bookInfo( book_t* );</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Step 3</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Define the book's implementation data type <span id="inlncode">bookimpl_t</span>
    in a private implementation file <span id="inlncode">libbook.c</span> adding
    one pointer to <span id="inlncode">str_t</span> to that data type.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.c:</span>
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include "libbook.h"
<strong>#include "libstr.h"</strong>

typedef struct
{
	book_t		bookadt;

	<strong>str_t*		title;</strong> /* Pointer to an integral part. */
} bookimpl_t;

static void		bookInfoImpl( book_t* );

static book_t	bookAdt = 
{ 
	bookInfoImpl
};</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Step 4</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In practice <span id="inlncode">logicalSize(), paddingAmount()</span> and
    <span id="inlncode">nextAddress()</span> family of functions will normally
    be packaged into a separate reusable library. However, for demonstration
    purposes and to avoid the clutter we will place these functions into the
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.c</span> file.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Step 5</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In <span id="inlncode">bookSizeOf()</span> calculate and return a size big
    enough for the whole and for all of its integral parts. Include: the size
    of the <span id="inlncode">bookimpl_t</span> structure plus the size of
    <span id="inlncode">str_t</span> as returned by
    <span id="inlncode">strSizeOf()</span> plus an extra space to align one
    <span id="inlncode">str_t</span> properly.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.c:</span>
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern size_t
bookSizeOf()
{
	size_t		rv;

	rv = sizeof( bookimpl_t ) +
	
		paddingAmount( sizeof( bookimpl_t ), strSizeOf() ) +

		strSizeOf();

	return rv;
}</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Step 6</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In <span id="inlncode">bookNew()</span> allocate enough space to hold the
    entire encapsulated whole with all of its integral parts and then call
    <span id="inlncode">bookConstruct()</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Make <span id="inlncode">bookNew()</span> and
    <span id="inlncode">bookConstruct()</span> accept all the information required
    to create its integral part - book's title - in addition to any information
    needed to create the book variable itself, if any.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.c:</span>
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern book_t*
bookNew( const char* <strong>title</strong> )
{
	book_t*		book = ( book_t* )NULL;
	void*		mem = calloc( 1, <strong>bookSizeOf()</strong> );

	book = bookConstruct( mem, <strong>title</strong> );

	return book;
}</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Step 7</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In <span id="inlncode">bookConstruct()</span> place an integral part in the
    memory block allocated by <span id="inlncode">bookNew()</span> at the
    appropriate address by calling <span id="inlncode">nextAddress()</span> with
    correct arguments.
    </p>

    <p>
    The first argument to <span id="inlncode">nextAddress()</span> in this case
    is where <span id="inlncode">bookimpl_t</span> is placed or
    <span id="inlncode">mem</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The second argument is the size of <span id="inlncode">bookimpl_t</span> as
    returned by C's unary operator <span id="inlncode">sizeof</span> - not the
    return value of <span id="inlncode">bookSizeOf()</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The third argument is the size of <span id="inlncode">str_t</span> as returned
    by <span id="inlncode">strSizeOf()</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Model <span id="inlncode">bookConstruct()</span> after
    <span id="inlncode">bookSizeOf()</span>. Assign the addresses to the integral
    parts in the same order <span id="inlncode">bookSizeOf()</span> uses them to
    calculate the amount of space needed for the whole.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.c:</span>
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern book_t*
bookConstruct( void* mem, const char* <strong>title</strong> )
{
	void*			adrs;
	bookimpl_t*		bimpl = ( bookimpl_t* )mem;

	bimpl->bookadt = bookAdt;

	<strong>adrs = nextAddress( mem, sizeof( bookimpl_t ), strSizeOf() );</strong>

	/*
	   Construct the integral part. It is possible because
	   str_t's construction is a public interface.
	 */
	<strong>bimpl->title = strConstruct( adrs, title );</strong>

	/*
	   Construct the whole and return it.
	 */
	return &bimpl->bookadt;
}</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Step 8</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In <span id="inlncode">bookDestruct()</span> dismantle all the integral
    parts first, then destruct the whole.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.c:</span>
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern void

	 */
	<strong>strDestruct( bimpl->title );</strong>

	/*
	   Then - destruct the whole.
	 */
}</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Step 9</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Implement <span id="inlncode">bookDelete()</span>.
    </p>

    <span id="inlncode">libbook.c:</span>
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern void

	{
		return;
	}

	bookDestruct( *book );

	free( *book );

	*book = ( book_t* )NULL;
}</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Step 10</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Implement <span id="inlncode">bookInfo()</span> and
    <span id="inlncode">bookInfoImpl()</span> to print the information of interest.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.c:</span>
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern void

	printf( "  &title - &book = %zu\n",
		( void* )( bimpl->title ) - ( void* )book );
}</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Step 11</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Since we are not exposing the implementation details of this book's title
    to the world this is where we apply the Chained Linking pattern by specifying
    <span id="inlncode">libstr.so</span> as <span id="inlncode">book_t</span>'s
    dependency:
    </p>

    <p id="cmdln">gcc -g -c -fPIC -I . libbook.c
gcc -g -L . -shared -o libbook.so libbook.o -lstr</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Step 12</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Write a sample program to manipulate a whole consisting of integral parts.

    </p>

    <p id="srccode">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "libbook.h"

extern int
main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
	book_t*		book = bookNew( "The C Programming Language" );

	bookInfo( book );

	bookDelete( &book );

	return 0;
}</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Step 13</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    To build <span id="inlncode">book</span> we only need to specify its dependency
    on <span id="inlncode">libbook.so</span>:
    </p>

    <p id="cmdln">gcc -g -c -I . book.c
gcc -g -L . -o book book.o -lbook</p>

    <p>
    Observe that the above build lines do not include the
    <span id="inlncode">libstr.so</span> library. The reason why this works is
    explained in Chained Linking chapter.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Step 14</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Run <span id="inlncode">book</span> in a debugger and step into all the
    interesting functions:
    </p>

    <p id="cmdln">./book
<span class="italic">libbook.c:137: bookInfoImpl()
 bookSizeOf() = 80
 sizeof( bookimpl_t ) = 16
 sizeof( book_t ) = 8
 sizeof( title ) = 8
 logical size of bookimpl_t = 40
 strSizeOf() = 40
  &book = 0x1e0f010
  &bookadt = 0x1e0f010
  padding amount = 24
  &title = 0x1e0f038
  &title - &book = 40</span></p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>From Here</strong>
    <p>

    <p>
    To add author's name to <span id="inlncode">book_t</span> follow these steps:
    </p>

    <p>
    - Add an extra argument to <span id="inlncode">bookNew()</span> and
    <span id="inlncode">bookConstruct()</span> in
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.h</span>:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern book_t*		bookNew( const char*<strong>, const char*</strong> );
extern book_t*		bookConstruct( void*, const char*<strong>, const char*</strong> );</p>

    <p>
    - Add an extra pointer to <span id="inlncode">str_t</span> to the book's
    implementation structure <span id="inlncode">bookimpl_t</span> in
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.c</span>:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">typedef struct
{
	book_t		bookadt;

	str_t*		title;
	<strong>str_t*		authors;</strong> /* Another integral part. */
} bookimpl_t;</p>

    <p>
    - Allocate enough space for the new integral part in
    <span id="inlncode">bookSizeOf()</span> in
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.c</span>:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern size_t
bookSizeOf()
{
	size_t		rv;

	rv = sizeof( bookimpl_t ) +

	paddingAmount( sizeof( bookimpl_t ), strSizeOf() ) +

	strSizeOf() +

	<strong>paddingAmount( strSizeOf(), strSizeOf() ) +

	strSizeOf();</strong>

	return rv;
}</p>

    <p>
    - Add an extra argument to <span id="inlncode">bookNew()</span> and
    <span id="inlncode">bookConstruct()</span> in
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.c</span>:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern book_t*
bookNew( const char* title, <strong>const char* authors</strong> )
{
	book_t*		book = ( book_t* )NULL;
	void*		mem = calloc( 1, bookSizeOf() );

	book = bookConstruct( mem, title, <strong>authors</strong> );

	return book;
}</p>

    <p>
    - Construct the new integral part in
    <span id="inlncode">bookConstruct()</span> in
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.c</span>:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern book_t*
bookConstruct( void* mem, const char* title, <strong>const char* authors</strong> )
{
	void*			adrs;
	bookimpl_t*		bimpl = ( bookimpl_t* )mem;

	bimpl->bookadt = bookAdt;

	adrs = nextAddress( mem, sizeof( bookimpl_t ), strSizeOf() );

	bimpl->title = strConstruct( adrs, title );

	<strong>adrs = nextAddress( bimpl->title, strSizeOf(), strSizeOf() );

	bimpl->authors = strConstruct( adrs, authors );</strong>

	/*
	   Construct the whole and return it.
	 */
	return &bimpl->bookadt;
}</p>

    <p>
    - Destruct the new integral part in <span id="inlncode">bookDestruct()</span>
    in <span id="inlncode">libbook.c</span>:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">extern void
bookDestruct( book_t* book )
{
	bookimpl_t*		bimpl = ( bookimpl_t* )book;

	strDestruct( bimpl->title );

	<strong>strDestruct( bimpl->authors );</strong>
}</p>

    <p>
    - Add the relevant details to <span id="inlncode">bookInfoImpl()c</span> in
    <span id="inlncode">libbook.c</span>:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">static void
bookInfoImpl( book_t* book )
{
	bookimpl_t*		bimpl = ( bookimpl_t* )book;

	printf( "%s:%d: bookInfoImpl()\n", __FILE__, __LINE__ );

	printf( " bookSizeOf() = %zu\n", bookSizeOf() );
	printf( " sizeof( bookimpl_t ) = %zu\n", sizeof( bookimpl_t ) );
	printf( " sizeof( book_t ) = %zu\n", sizeof( book_t ) );
	printf( " sizeof( title ) = %zu\n", sizeof( str_t* ) );
	<strong>printf( " sizeof( authors ) = %zu\n", sizeof( str_t* ) );</strong>
	printf( " logical size of bookimpl_t = %zu\n",
		logicalSize( sizeof( bookimpl_t ), strSizeOf() ) );
	printf( " strSizeOf() = %zu\n", strSizeOf() );
	printf( "  &book = %p\n", ( void* )book );
	printf( "  &bookadt = %p\n", ( void* )( &bimpl->bookadt ) );
	printf( "  padding amount = %zu\n",
		paddingAmount( sizeof( bookimpl_t ), strSizeOf() ) );
	printf( "  &title = %p\n", ( void* )( bimpl->title ) );
	printf( "  &title - &book = %zu\n",
		( void* )( bimpl->title ) - ( void* )book );
	<strong>printf( "  &authors = %p\n", ( void* )( bimpl->authors ) );
	printf( "  &authors - &title = %zu\n",
		( void* )( bimpl->authors ) - ( void* )( bimpl->title ) );</strong>
}</p>

    <p>
    - Rebuild <span id="inlncode">libbook.so</span>:
    </p>

    <p id="cmdln">gcc -g -c -fPIC -I . libbook.c
gcc -g -L . -shared -o libbook.so libbook.o -lstr</p>

    <p>
    - Adjust <span id="inlncode">bookNew()</span> in
    <span id="inlncode">book.c</span> to accept the book's author(s):
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "libbook.h"

extern int
main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
	book_t*		book = bookNew( "The C programming language", <strong>"K & R"</strong> );

	bookInfo( book );

	bookDelete( &book );

	return 0;
}</p>

    <p>
    - Rebuild <span id="inlncode">book</span>:
    </p>

    <p id="cmdln">gcc -g -c -I . book.c
gcc -g -L . -o book book.o -lbook</p>

    <p>
    Exercise the new functionality:
    </p>

    <p id="cmdln">./book
<span class="italic">libbook.c:148: bookInfoImpl()
 bookSizeOf() = 120
