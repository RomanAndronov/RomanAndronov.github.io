    <h1>Tangency, Radical Axis, Power</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Points of Tangency</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Property ICP36</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>If a straight line \(l\) and a circle \(q\) touch each other at a point
    \(T\) different from the center of inversion \(O\) then their images \(l'\)
    and \(q'\) under an inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) must also
    touch at a point \(T'\) which is an image of \(T\) under the same inversion
    with respect to \(c(O, r)\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP37</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>If two circles \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) touch each other at a point \(T\)
    different from the center of inversion \(O\) then their images \(q'_1\) and
    \(q'_2\) under an inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) must also
    touch at a point \(T'\) which is an image of \(T\) under the same inversion
    with respect to \(c(O, r)\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    These properties apply to inversion with positive and negative powers and
    follow from the angle preservation properties and the fact that by definition
    a tangency point is single - meaning just one point corresponding to a
    limiting position of a secant to a given curve at that point. From
    <strong>ICP6</strong> it follows that the image of such a point \(T\) under
    the inversion with respect to \(c(O, r)\) is unique. Therefore if \(T\)
    belongs to two curves at once then its image \(T'\) must also belong to the
    images of these curves as well.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Orthogonal Circles</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    From <strong>ICD2</strong> it follows that two curves are orthogonal at a
    point \(P\) or intersect orthogonally at a point \(P\) if their tangents at
    \(P\) are perpendicular. In practical terms then two circles are orthogonal
    if their radii form a right angle at any intersection point. From
    <strong>B3P36,37</strong> two properties follow:
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Property ICP38</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Any circle \(q\) passing through two points \(A\) and \(A'\) inverse
    to each other with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) with positive power is
    orthogonal to \(c\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    From <strong>ICC3</strong> we have:
    </p>

$$OA \times OA' = r^2$$

    <p>
    The locus of centers of circles passing through \(A\) and \(A'\) must, by
    definition, be on the perpendicular bisector of \(AA'\), \(p\). Pick an
    arbitrary point \(Q\) on \(p\). Construct a circle centered at \(Q\) with
    radius \(QA = QA'\). Name one point where \(c\) and \(q\) intersect \(P\).
    Since \(P\) is on \(c\)'s circumference, \(OP = r\) and hence:
    </p>

$$OA \times OA' = r^2 = OP^2$$

    <p>
    Since \(P\) is on \(q\)'s circumference, <strong>B3P37</strong> is applicable
    to a point \(O\), a secant \(OA'\) and a line \(OP\) falling on a circle \(q\):
    </p>

    <p>
    if \(OP^2 = OA \times OA'\) then \(OP\) touches \(q\)
    </p>

    <p>
    Since:
    </p>

$$OP^2 = OA \times OA'$$

    <p>
    is indeed true then it follows that \(OP\) is perpendicular to \(QP\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc40.png" class="center">

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP39</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>If two circles \(c(O, r)\) and \(q(Q, R)\) are orthogonal then two points
    of intersection of any secant of \(q\) through \(O\) are inverses of each other
    with respect to \(c\) with positive power and vice versa</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Here we are given that \(OP\) is tangent to \(q\), \(O\) is outside \(q\) and
    hence for any secant of \(q\) through \(O\) from <strong>B3P36</strong> it
    follows that:
    </p>

$$OP^2 = OA \times OA'$$

    <p>
    but:
    </p>

$$OP = r$$

    <p>
    \(O\), \(A\) and \(A'\) are collinear with \(A\) and \(A'\) on the same side
    of \(O\). Hence, \(A\) and \(A'\) are inverses of each other with respect to
    \(c\) with positive power. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that we can repeat all the previous deductions by applying them to any
    secant of \(c\) through \(Q\) and prove that if \(c\) and \(q\) are orthogonal
    then the two points of intersection of any secant of \(c\) through \(Q\) are
    inverses of each other with respect to \(q\) with positive power.
    </p>

    <p>
    From the above two properties the next one follows right away:
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP40</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>If two circles \(c(O, r)\) and \(q(Q, R)\) are orthogonal then each of
    them is invariant under the inversion with positive power with respect to the
    remaining circle</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us consider an inversion of \(q\) with respect to \(c\). From
    <strong>ICP39</strong> it follows that \(c\) splits \(q\) into two mutually
    inverse arcs - the inner arc, inside \(c\), and the outer arc, outside \(c\).
    Barring the intersection points of \(q\) and \(c\) (which are fixed) all the
    other points on the inner arc of \(q\) have their images on the outer arc of
    \(q\) and vice versa.
    </p>

    <p>
    It follows then that even though these points on \(q\) do not transform into
    themselves \(q\) as a whole - does. This proves that \(q\) is invariant under
    the inversion with positive power with respect to \(c\) which is yet another
    example of an invariant figure and an identity transformation.
    </p>

    <p>
    We can now swap the roles of \(c\) and \(q\) and repeat the above paragraph
    verbatim proving that \(c\) is invariant under the inversion with positive
    power with respect to \(q\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Even though the following circles are not, of course, orthogonal but for
    inversions with negative power there is a property similar, at the intuitive
    level, to that of <strong>ICP40</strong>:
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Property ICP41</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Any circle \(q\) that passes through two diametrically opposite points
    \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) on another circle \(c(O, r)\) is invariant under the
    inversion with respect to \(c\) with negative power</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Construct a Line(\(P_1\), \(P_2\)) and a line \(p\) through \(O\) perpendicular
    to Line(\(P_1\), \(P_2\)). Name the intersection points of \(p\) and \(q\) as
    \(A\) and \(A'_n\). The circumference angle \(\angle AP_1A'_n\) subtends the
    diameter \(AA'_n\) and hence is right (<strong>B3P31</strong>). In
    \(\triangle AP_1A'_n\) Line(\(P_1\), \(P_2\)) is a perpendicular drawn from
    the right angle at \(P_1\) to the base \(AA'_n\). From <strong>B6P8</strong>
    it follows then that \(\triangle AOP_1\) and \(\triangle P_1OA'_n\) are
    similar and hence (<strong>B6P4</strong>):
    </p>

$$\frac {OA}{OP_1} = \frac {OP_1}{OA'_n}$$
$$OA \times OA'_n = OP_1^2 = r^2$$

    <p>
    From <strong>ICC1,2,3</strong> it follows then that \(A\) and \(A'_n\) are
    inverses of each other with respect to \(c\) with negative power. Further,
    pick an arbitrary point \(B\) on \(q\) and construct a Line(\(B\), \(O\))
    which will intersect \(q\) at \(B'_n\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc41.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Since <strong>B3P35</strong> applies to <dfn>any</dfn> intersecting chords
    of \(q\), we have:
    </p>

$$OB \times OB'_n = OA \times OA'_n = r^2$$

    <p>
    which means that \(B\) and \(B'_n\) are images of each other under the
    inversion with respect to \(c\) with negative power. Here, again, \(c\) cuts
    \(q\) into two mutually inverse arcs and, consequently, \(q\) is invariant
    under the inversion with respect to \(c\) with negative power. Note, however,
    that \(c\) is not invariant under the inversion with negative power with
    respect to \(q\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Property ICP42</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>If a circle \(q\) is invariant under the inversion with respect to a
    circle \(c(O, r)\) with negative power then \(q\) cuts \(c\) at two points
    \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) diametrically opposite to each other on \(c\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    This property is the converse of <strong>ICP41</strong>. Since \(q\) is
    invariant under the inversion with respect to \(c\) with negative power, any
    pair of points on \(q\) must trade places while staying collinear with \(O\).
    The points of intersection of \(q\) and \(c\), \(P_1\) and \(P_2\), form such
    a pair and since they too must be collinear with \(O\) they must be
    diametrically opposite to each other on \(c\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>Now that we know that angles and tangency points under inversion are
    preserved we can investigate how the centers of inverse circles are connected
    to each other in reference to the center of inversion:
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Exercise ICE9</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Given a circle of inversion \(c(O, r)\) and two circles \(q(Q, R)\) and
    \(q'(Q', R')\) which are inverses of each other with respect to \(c\) find a
    way to invert \(Q\) into \(Q'\) and vice versa</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us consider an inversion with positive power first.
    </p>

    <p>
    From <strong>ICD2</strong> it follows that <dfn>any</dfn> straight line through
    \(Q\) is orthogonal to \(q\). Out of multitude of such lines let us pick a
    convenient one that does not pass through \(O\) - a line \(p\) perpendicular
    to Line(\(O\), \(Q\)). We know that inversion preserves angles so if \(p\)
    is orthogonal to \(q\) then the image of \(p\) with respect to \(c\), \(p'\),
    must remain orthogonal to the image of \(q\) with respect to \(c\), \(q'\).
    </p>

    <p>
    However, in this case from <strong>ICP10</strong> it follows that \(p'\) is
    a circle that passes through \(O\). Since \(p'\) is orthogonal to \(q'\),
    from <strong>ICP40</strong> it follows that \(p'\) is invariant under the
    inversion with respect to \(q'\) with positive power which in turn means that
    \(O'\) is the image of \(O\) with respect to \(q'\) under that inversion.
    </p>

    <p>
    From our construction of \(p'\), see <strong>ICP10</strong>, it follows that
    \(O'\) is also the image of \(Q\) with respect to \(c\). As such, the point
    \(O'\) plays two roles at the same time and the solution to our problem
    should be obvious now:
    </p>

    <p>
    to locate \(Q\) we first invert \(O\) with respect to \(q'\) (with positive
    power) into \(O'\) and then we invert \(O'\) with respect to \(c\) (also with
    positive power) into \(Q\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc42.png" class="center">

    <p>
    We can now reverse the order of operations and formulate the solution for
    locating \(Q'\) - first invert \(O\) with respect to \(q\) into \(O'\) and
    then invert \(O'\) with respect to \(c\) to locate \(Q'\). We did not supply
    the drawing for this scenario - you are encouraged to do it yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us now consider an inversion with negative power.
    </p>

    <p>
    Construct a perpendicular \(p\) to Line(\(O\), \(Q\)) and invert it with
    respect to \(c\) with negative power. While doing so we will obtain a point
    \(O'\) which is an image of \(Q\) with respect to \(c\), see
    <strong>ICP11</strong>. Since \(p\) is orthogonal to \(q\), its image, \(p'\),
    will remain orthogonal to the image of \(q\), \(q'\). From
    <strong>ICP40</strong> it follows then that \(p'\) is invariant under the
    inversion with respect to \(q'\) with positive power which in turn means that
    \(O'\) is an image of \(O\) under that inversion.
    </p>

    <p>
    From here we conclude that to locate \(Q\) we first invert \(O\) with respect
    to \(q'\) with <dfn>positive</dfn> (!) power into \(O'\) and then we invert
    \(O'\) with respect to \(c\) with <dfn>negative</dfn> (!) power into \(Q\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc43.png" class="center">

    <p>
    We can now reverse the order of operations and state that to locate \(Q'\)
    we first invert \(O\) with respect to \(q\) with <dfn>positive</dfn> (!)
    power into \(O'\) and then we invert \(O'\) with respect to \(c\) with
    <dfn>negative</dfn> (!) power into \(Q'\). We did not supply the drawing for
    this scenario - you are encouraged to do it yourself.

    <br><strong>A Power of a Point</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Definition ICD3</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>A power \(\mathcal{P}\) of a point \(A\) with respect to a circle
    \(q(Q, r)\) is the difference between the square of the distance from the
    point \(A\) to the center of the circle \(Q\) and the square of the radius
    of the circle \(r\):</dfn>
    </p>

$$\mathcal{P}(A, q) = d^2 - r^2 = AQ^2 - r^2$$

    <img src="imgs/irc44.png" class="center">

    <p>
    <strong>Case 1</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    If \(A\) is located outside \(q\) then:
    </p>

$$AQ = d > r$$

    <p>
    the difference of squares is positive and it can be rearranged as follows:
    </p>

$$\mathcal{P}(A, q) = d^2 - r^2 = (d + r)(d - r) = AT^2$$

    <p>
    The sum \((d + r)\) is the entire length of the secant of \(q\) through \(A\)
    while the difference \((d - r)\) is its outer portion. If we construct a
    tangent \(AT\) to \(q\) through \(A\) then from <strong>B3P36</strong> the
    above formula follows right away and we observe that in this particular case
    a power of the point \(A\) with respect to \(q\) is the square of the length
    of the tangent to \(q\) through \(A\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Further, if we construct a circle \(s(A, AT)\) (not shown) then its radius
    \(AT\) is perpendicular to the radius \(QT\) and if follows that \(s\) and
    \(q\) are orthogonal. We will use this observation later in <strong>Radical
    Axis</strong> section.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Case 2</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    If \(A\) is located directly on the circumference of \(q\) then:
    </p>

$$d = r$$

    <p>
    and the power of \(A\) with respect to \(q\) is zero.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Case 3</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    If \(A\) is located inside \(q\) then:
    </p>

$$d < r$$

    <p>
    the power of \(A\) with respect to \(q\) is negative and it can be rearranged
    as follows:
    </p>

$$\mathcal{P}(A, q) = d^2 - r^2 =$$
$$-(r^2 - d^2) =$$
$$(r + d)(r - d) =$$
$$-AK \times AL =$$
$$-AM \times AN$$

    <p>
    for any secant of \(q\) \(MN\) which follows from <strong>B3P35</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Radical Axis</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Definition ICD4</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>A radical axis of two circles \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) is a locus of points
    whose powers with respect to \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are equal</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Instead of proving each of the upcoming cases separately it is easier to use
    one theorem to cover them all:
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Theorem ICT1</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>A radical axis of any two nonconcentric circles \(q_1(Q_1, r_1)\) and
    \(q_2(Q_2, r_2)\) is a straight line perpendicular to the straight line
    passing through the centers of these circles \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    We can always choose an orthogonal \(xOy\) coordinate system in such a way
    the its \(x\)-axis passes through the points \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\) and its
    \(y\)-axis passes through the middle point \(O\) between \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    If we take:
    </p>

$$OQ_1 = OQ_2 = a$$

    <p>
    then:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc45.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Next, we can place an arbitrary point \(A\) anywhere with respect to the axes
    and the points \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\) but regardless of this placement the proof
    follows the same path. Let \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) be the distances from such an
    arbitrary point \(A\) to the centers \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\) correspondingly. By
    definition of a power of a point with respect to a circle we have:
    </p>

$$\mathcal{P}_1(A, q_1) = d_1^2 - r_1^2$$
$$\mathcal{P}_2(A, q_2) = d_2^2 - r_2^2$$
$$\mathcal{P}_1 = \mathcal{P}_2$$
$$d_1^2 - r_1^2 = d_2^2 - r_2^2$$
$$d_1^2 - d_2^2 = r_1^2 - r_2^2 = const = k$$

    <p>
    We can also safely assume that:
    </p>

$$k \geqslant 0$$

    <p>
    since if it is not then we can always swap the roles of the circles and
    renumber them.
    </p>

    <p>
    The coordinates of an arbitrary point \(A\) are \((x, y)\) (which can vary)
    and from the right triangles \(\triangle AxQ_1\) and \(\triangle AxQ_2\) we
    have:
    </p>

$$d_1^2 = y^2 + (a + x)^2 = y^2 + a^2 + 2ax + x^2$$
$$d_2^2 = y^2 + (x - a)^2 = y^2 + x^2 - 2xa + a^2$$
$$d_1^2 - d_2^2 = 4ax = k$$
$$x = \frac {k}{4a}$$

    <p>
    which is an equation of a straight line perpendicular to the \(\)-axis.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Case 1</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    From this theorem and the definition of a power of a point with respect to a
    circle it follows that the radical axis \(a\) of two circles \(q_1\) and
    \(q_2\) that intersect at \(A\) and \(B\) is a straight line through \(A\)
    and \(B\) as the powers of both intersection points with respect to \(q_1\)
    and \(q_2\) are equal, zero, and two distinct points define a unique straight
    line which is also perpendicular to Line(\(Q_1\), \(Q_2\)).
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Case 2</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    If two circles touch at \(T\) externally or internally then the powers of
    \(T\) with respect to both circles are equal, zero. Hence, the radical axis
    \(a\) must pass through \(T\) and it must be perpendicular to the straight
    line passing through the centers of the touching circles. In this case the
    radical axis \(a\) coincides with the tangent through \(T\) common to both
    circles.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Case 3</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    There is more than one way to construct a radical axis \(a\) of two circles
    that are not in contact and are outside each other. One way would be to
    observe that in this particular case a power of a point with respect to a
    circle is the square of the length of a tangent through the point to the
    circle. Hence, to find a radical axis of two such circles we need to find a
    point the length of a tangent from which to both circles is the same. One
    such obvious point, for example, is a middle point \(M\) of a common external
    tangent \(T_1T_2\): \(MT_1 = MT_2\). Constructing a straight line through
    \(M\) perpendicular to the straight line through the centers of both circles
    locates their radical axis \(a\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc46.png" class="center">

    <p>
    <strong>Case 4</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    It is easier to construct the radical axis \(a\) of two nonconcentric circles
    that are not in contact and one is inside the other by using the method of
    intersecting loci. Here we employ the fact that a radical axis of two
    intersecting circles is a straight line passing through their intersection
    points.
    </p>

    <p>
    Construct an arbitrary helper circle \(w_1\) that intersects both given
    circles and thus locates two pairs of intersection points. Then, \(a_1\) is
    a radical axis of \(q_1\) and \(w_1\) and \(b_1\) is a radical axis of \(q_2\)
    and \(w_1\). It stands to reason then that \(a_1\) and \(b_1\) intersect at
    a point \(P_1\) which must belong to a radical axis of \(q_1\) and \(q_2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Now either construct a second pair of intersecting radical axes (as we have
    done) or construct a straight line through \(P_1\) perpendicular to
    Line(\(Q_1\), \(Q_2\)):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc47.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Lastly, let us consider the points on the radical axis. Some of these points
    can be located inside both circles, as in <strong>Case 1</strong>, for
    example, between the points \(A\) and \(B\), while others can be located on
    both circles, as in case <strong>Case 2</strong> for the point \(T\), or
    outside both circles, as in all the other cases.
    </p>

    <p>
    When a point on a radical axis is located outside (or on) both circles then
    we can apply the <strong>Power of a Point, Case 1</strong> observation -
    any circle centered at such a point with a radius equal to the length of a
    tangent to either circle through that point will be orthogonal to both given
    circles simultaneously. When a point on a radical axis is located on both
    given circles, point \(T\) in <strong>Case 2</strong>, then we simply have
    a case of a degenerate circle of zero radius.
    </p>

    It follows then that for any point on a radical axis located on or outside
    both given circles there exists a unique circle orthogonal to both of them.
    In other words, the locus of the centers of circles orthogonal to both given
    circles is the entire radical axis for the cases <strong>2, 3</strong> and
    <strong>4</strong> and the entire radical axis excluding the
    LineSegment(\(A\), \(B\)) for <strong>Case 1</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    To construct one such circle choose a point on a radical axis that is located
    outside both given circles, \(P\), construct a tangent through \(P\) to one
    of the given circles to locate their tangency point \(T_1\), draw a
    Circle(\(P\), \(PT_1\)):

    It is also fairly obvious to observe and easy to prove the converse statement:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>if a circle \(q\) is orthogonal to two given circles \(q_1\) and \(q_2\)
    then its center must be located on the radical axis of \(q_1\) and \(q_2\)</dfn>
