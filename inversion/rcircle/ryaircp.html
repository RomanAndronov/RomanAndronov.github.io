    <h1>Points</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Property ICP1</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) with positive
    power any point \(A\) on \(c\) is transformed into itself</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Such points are called <dfn>fixed</dfn>. From <strong>ICC3</strong> for any
    point \(A\) on \(c\) we have:
    </p>

$$OA \times OA' = r^2$$
$$OA = r$$
$$r \times OA' = r^2$$
$$OA' = r$$

    <p>
    From the above and <strong>ICC2</strong> it follows that \(A'\) does coincide
    with \(A\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP2</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) with negative
    power any point \(A\) on \(c\) is transformed into a point on \(c\)
    diametrically opposite to \(A\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    From <strong>ICC3</strong> for any point \(A\) on \(c\) we have:
    </p>

$$OA \times OA' = r^2$$
$$OA = r$$
$$r \times OA' = r^2$$
$$OA' = r$$

    <p>
    Since all three points must be collinear and \(O\) must be between \(A\) and
    \(A'\), it follows that \(A'\) is located on \(c\) diametrically opposite to
    \(A\).

    called <dfn>identity transformations</dfn>. This property is common for
    inversions with negative and positive powers and it follows directly from

    For any point \(A\) inside \(c\) from <strong>ICC3</strong> we have:

    Again, to construct the radius of inversion we can change the steps of

    <p>

    <br><strong>Property ICP6</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>A point \(A'\) inverse to a point \(A\) under the inversion with respect
    to a circle \(c(O, r)\) is unique</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    This follows directly from <strong>ICC3</strong>. Algebraically, if we put
    \(x = OA'\) and take that \(r^2 = const\) and \(OA\) as known, we obtain: 
    </p>

$$x = \frac {r^2}{OA}$$

    <p>
    a first degree equation yielding a unique solution.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP7</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg"l>
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) an even number
    of inversions of a point \(A\) with respect to \(c\) transforms \(A\) into
    itself</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Two consecutive inversions is all we need to look at. Assume that \(A\) is
    inverted into \(A'\) and \(A'\) is inverted into \(A''\) with respect to \(c\).
    From <strong>ICC3</strong> we have: 
    </p>
 
$$OA \times OA' = r^2$$
$$OA' \times OA'' = r^2$$

    <p>
    Since \(A'\) is unique (<strong>ICP6</strong>) and \(OA'\) is one and the same:
    </p>

$$\frac {r^2}{OA} = \frac {r^2}{OA''}$$
$$OA = OA''$$

    <p>
    and since all three points are collinear (<strong>ICC2</strong>), \(A''\) must
    coincide with \(A\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Another way to look at this property is to state that:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg" class="center">
    <dfn>"if a point \(A'\) is the inverse of a point \(A\) under the inversion
    with respect to a circle \(c\) then \(A\) is the inverse of \(A'\) with
    respect to \(c\)"</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP8</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>An inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) with negative power
    is equivalent to an inversion with respect to the same circle \(c\) with
    positive power with a consequent \(180\)-degree rotation about \(O\), and
    conversely</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Inverting \(A\) with respect to \(c\) with positive power puts \(A'\) on the
    same side of \(O\) while inverting \(A\) with respect to \(c\) with negative
    power puts \(A'_n\) on the opposite side of \(O\). From the previous properties
    it follows then that regardless of where \(A\) is in reference to \(c\) (in,
    on, out) we have:
    </p>

$$OA \times OA' = r^2 = OA \times OA'_n$$
$$OA' = OA'_n$$

    <p>
    The <strong>ICE2</strong> and <strong>ICE4</strong> drawings demonstrate this
    idea.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since the inversions with positive and negative power are equivalent in the
    above sense, we can exploit this fact to our advantage by choosing the most
    convenient inversion type to derive a proof or a solution to a problem and
    then claim the same for the remaining inversion type.
