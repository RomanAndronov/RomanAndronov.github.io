    <h1>Inversion with Respect to a Circle in a Real Plane</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Definition ICD1</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    An inversion of a plane \(p\) with respect to a circle \(c\) with a center
    at \(O\) and a radius \(r\) is a transformation of \(p\) when a point \(A\)
    is taken into a point \(A'\) in such a way that:
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Condition ICC1:</strong> \(A\) and \(A'\) are different from \(O\)
    and \(P_{\infty}\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Condition ICC2:</strong> \(O\), \(A\) and \(A'\) are collinear
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Condition ICC3:</strong> \(OA \times OA' = r^2\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>The circle \(c\) is called the <dfn>circle of inversion</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The point \(O\) is called the <dfn>center of inversion</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The radius \(r\) is called the <dfn>radius of inversion</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The square of the radius of inversion is called the <dfn>power of
    inversion</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The point \(A'\) is also called an <dfn>image</dfn> of \(A\) under the
    inversion with respect to \(c\).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If \(A\) and \(A'\) are both located on one side of \(O\) then the power of
    inversion is said to be <dfn>positive</dfn>, \(+r^2\) or simply \(r^2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    If \(A\) and \(A'\) are located on either side of \(O\) then the power of
    inversion is said to be <dfn>negative</dfn>, \(-r^2\). The negative sign in
    front of the power of inversion is largely symbolic - it is used to
    distinguish between the two possible locations of \(A\) and \(A'\) relative
    to \(O\) and we will mostly omit it unless required by the context.
    </p>

    <p>
    As such, we will refer to the power of inversion verbally as in
    <dfn>"inversion with negative power"</dfn> or <dfn>"inversion with positive
    power"</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    If the qualifier of the power of inversion is omitted then it means that the
    inversion in question is applicable to both power types.
    <p>

    <p>
    Under the inversion with respect to a circle the center of inversion \(O\)
    does not really have an image. This follows from <strong>ICC3</strong>
    directly if we diminish the length of the line segment \(OA\) without bound.
    For completeness, though, we shall take it that the center of inversion \(O\)
    is transformed into \(P_{\infty}\) and \(P_{\infty}\) is transformed into the
    center of inversion \(O\).
