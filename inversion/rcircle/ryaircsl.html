    <h1>Straight Lines</h1>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP9</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) a straight line
    \(l\) passing through \(O\) is transformed into itself</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    If the inversion power is negative then <dfn>all</dfn> the points on \(l\)
    trade places (<strong>ICP7</strong>) while staying collinear including \(O\)
    that goes into \(P_{\infty}\) and \(P_{\infty}\) that goes into \(O\).
    </p>

    <p>
    If the inversion power is positive then also all the points on \(l\) trade
    places except for two intersection points of \(l\) and \(c\) which stay
    where they are.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP10</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) with positive
    power a straight line \(l\) that does not pass through \(O\) and has exactly
    two common points with \(c\), \(F_1\) and \(F_2\), is transformed into a
    circle \(q'\) passing through \(O\) and \(F_1\) and \(F_2\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Construct a perpendicular \(p\) to \(l\) through \(O\) to locate the point of
    their intersection \(P\). Invert \(P\) with respect to \(c\) with positive
    power (<strong>ICE1</strong>). Invert an arbitrary point \(A\) on \(l\) inside
    \(c\) to locate \(A'\). Consider \(\triangle OPA\) and \(\triangle OA'P'\).
    They share a common angle at \(O\). From <strong>ICC3</strong> we have:
    </p>
 
$$OP \times OP' = r^2 = OA \times OA'$$
$$\frac {OP}{OA} = \frac {OA'}{OP'}$$
 
    <p>
    which means that the two triangles have two sides about the equal angle in
    the same proportion - the essence of <strong>B6P6</strong>. Hence, they are
    similar and their corresponding angles, \(\angle OPA\) and \(\angle OA'P'\),
    are equal. But \(\triangle OPA\) is right by construction and hence
    \(\triangle OA'P'\) is right:
    </p>

    <p>
    Since \(A\) was picked at random, the locus traced by \(A'\) must be a
    circumference of a circle with diameter \(OP'\) which can be verified by
    using a different point, \(B\), on \(l\) outside \(c\).
    </p>

    <p>
    This suggests the following straight edge and compass construction:
    </p>
 
    <p>
    1) Perpendicular \(p\) to \(l\) through \(O\)
    </p>

    <p>
    2) LineSegment(\(O\), \(F_1\)) bisector \(s\) until it intersects \(p\) at
    \(Q'\)
    </p>

    <p>
    3) Circle(\(Q'\), \(Q'F_1 = Q'O\)) = \(q'\):
    </p>

    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) with negative
    power a straight line \(l\) that does not pass through \(O\) and has exactly
    two common points with \(c\), \(F_1\) and \(F_2\), is transformed into a
    circle \(q'\) passing through \(O\) and \(F'_1\) and \(F'_2\) which are the
    points diametrically opposite to \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) correspondingly</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Here we can reap the benefits afforded by <strong>ICP8</strong> and use
    <strong>ICP10</strong> to construct an image of \(l\) under the inversion
    with respect to \(c\) with positive power and then rotate it \(180\) degrees
    about \(O\).
    </p>

    <p>
    However, it is a good exercise to construct the proof of this property from
    first principles yourself. We will just highlight the fact that the
    corresponding angles at \(O\) are not shared this time but are vertical and
    from <strong>B1P15</strong> it follows that they are equal. The rest of the
    proof follows the one from <strong>ICP10</strong> pretty much verbatim:

    <p>
    3) LineSegment(\(O\), \(F'_1\)) bisector \(s\) until it intersects \(p\) at

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) with positive
    power a straight line \(l\) that has exactly one common point with \(c\) at

    \(T\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Since \(T\) is on the circumference of \(c\) - it is fixed. From
    <strong>B3P16</strong> it follows that an arbitrary point \(A\) on \(l\)
    different from \(T\) will be outside \(c\). \(A\)'s inverse \(A'\) will then
    be thrown inside \(c\), <strong>ICP5</strong>. By construction
    (<strong>ICE3</strong>) \(\angle OA'T\) is right. Hence, \(\triangle OA'T\)
    is right. Hence, from <strong>B3P31</strong>, in a circle the angle in the
    semicircle is right, it follows that the locus traced by \(A'\) must be a
    circumference of a circle with diameter \(OT\) since \(A\) was picked at
    random:

    The straight edge and compass construction steps are especially easy this time:

    Based on <strong>ICP8</strong> we can use <strong>ICP12</strong> to construct
    an image of \(l\) under the inversion with respect to \(c\) with positive
    power and then rotate it \(180\) degrees about \(O\). It pays, however, to
    construct the proof of this property from first principles yourself:

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) a straight

    Verbally this property sounds the same for inversions with positive and
    negative powers. The only difference between them is the location of the
    image relative to \(l\). For an inversion with positive power \(q'\) and
    \(c\) are on the same side of \(O\) and for an inversion with negative power
    they are on the opposite sides of \(O\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us prove this property for an inversion with negative power. Construct a
    perpendicular \(p\) to \(l\) through \(O\) to locate their intersection point
    \(P\). Invert \(P\) with respect to \(c\) with negative power
    (<strong>ICE4</strong>). Invert an arbitrary point \(A\) on \(l\) to locate
    \(A'\). Consider \(\triangle OPA\) and \(\triangle OA'P'\). Their angles at
    \(O\) are vertical and, hence, equal. From <strong>ICC3</strong> we have:
    </p>
 
$$OP \times OP' = r^2 = OA \times OA'$$
$$\frac {OP}{OA} = \frac {OA'}{OP'}$$
 
    <p>
    which means that the two triangles have two sides about the equal angles in
    the same proportion - the essence of <strong>B6P6</strong>. Hence, they are
    similar and their corresponding angles, \(\angle OPA\) and \(\angle OA'P'\),
    are equal. But \(\triangle OPA\) is right by construction and hence
    \(\triangle OA'P'\) is right:

    Since \(A\) was picked at random, the locus traced by \(A'\) must be a

    This suggests the following straight edge and compass construction (for both
    powers):
    </p>
 
    <p>
    1) Perpendicular \(p\) to \(l\) through \(O\) to locate their intersection at
    \(P\)

    3) LineSegment(\(O\), \(P'\)) bisector \(s\) until it intersects
    Line(\(O\), \(P\)) at \(Q'\)
    </p>

    4) Circle(\(Q'\), \(Q'P' = Q'O\)) = \(q'\):
