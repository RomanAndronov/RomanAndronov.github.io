    <h1>Problems 01</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Algorithm</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    Aside from using inversion to construct a reciprocal of a given linear measure
    I have identified one inversion with respect to a circle-based problem solving
    algorithm:
    </p>

    <p>
    - choose a convenient center of inversion
    </p>

    <p>
    - choose a convenient radius of inversion
    </p> 

    <p>
    - choose a convenient power of inversion
    </p> 

    <p>
    - invert the original object(s) with respect to the circle of inversion
    found in the previous steps
    </p>

    <p>
    - solve a (presumably easier) problem in terms of the inverse object(s)
    </p> 

    <p>
    - using the preservation of angles and tangent points and other basic
    properties of inversion convert the solution in terms of the inverse
    object(s) obtained in the previous step into the solution in terms of the
    original object(s)
    </p> 

    <p>
    <br><strong>Tangent Circles</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Problem 1</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Construct all circles which are tangent to a given circle \(q(Q, R)\),
    pass through a given point \(P\) and have their centers located on a straight
    line passing through \(P\) and \(Q\)</dfn>
     </p>

    <p>
    Two interesting cases in this problem are 1) the given point \(P\) is
    <dfn>outside</dfn> \(q(Q, R)\) and 2) the given point \(P\) is
    <dfn>inside</dfn> \(q(Q, R)\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us investigate the first case together and the second case you can do
    yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
    Construct a \(Line(P, Q)\) until it intersects \(q(Q, R)\) at \(A\) and \(B\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Center of Inversion</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We know that the circles sought after must pass through \(P\). We also remember
    that circles passing through the center of inversion become straight lines
    (which are "easier" to construct). Inversely - certain straight lines become
    circles passing through the center of inversion. It makes sense then to pick
    the given point \(P\) as a center of inversion - if we somehow construct these
    straight lines and invert them back then we will obtain our circles. 
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Radius of Inversion</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    It does not really matter which radius of inversion we choose but in order to
    minimize the number of points we need to invert let us choose \(PA\) as a
    radius of inversion (you should also try \(PB\) as a radius of inversion): 
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ircp01.png" class="center">

    <p>
    <strong>Power of Inversion</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    It makes sense to choose a positive power of inversion.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Invert</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    According to <strong>ICP25</strong> under the inversion with respect to
    \(c(P, PA)\) with positive power the circle \(q(Q, R)\) becomes
    \(q'(Q', R')\) - a circle touching \(c(P, PA)\) at \(A\) internally. Under
    that inversion the point \(B\) is thrown inside \(c(P, PA)\) becoming \(B'\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Solution in Terms of Inverse Objects</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    The solution in terms of the inverse objects is a pair of tangents to
    \(q'(Q', R')\) - one at \(A\), \(t_1\), and one at \(B'\), \(t_2\), - a pair
    of straight lines touching the <dfn>image</dfn> of the given circle at two
    points which are also the <dfn>images</dfn> of the target points.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Solution in Terms of Original Objects</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Just because of the way we have chosen our circle of inversion the straight
    line \(t_1\) is tangent to \(c\) at \(A\). From <strong>ICP12</strong> it
    follows that \(t_1\) will invert into a circle passing through \(P\) and
    touching \(c\) at \(A\) internally and touching the given circle \(q\) at
    \(A\) externally.
    </p>

    <p>
    From <strong>ICP36</strong> we know that under inversion tangency points
    are preserved. If \(t_1\) and \(q'\) touch then their images will also touch.
    This is exactly what we want and thus the first required circle is
    constructed - invert \(t_1\) with respect to \(c\) with positive power. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The straight line \(t_2\) does not pass through \(P\) and intersects \(c\) at
    exactly two points, \(F_1\) and \(F_2\). From <strong>ICP10</strong> it
    follows that \(t_2\) will invert into a circle passing through \(P\), \(F_1\),
    \(F_2\). To locate the center of this circle we bisect \(LineSegment(P, F_1)\).
    </p>

    <p>
    From <strong>ICP36</strong> we know that under inversion tangency points are
    preserved. If \(t_2\) and \(q'\) touch at \(B'\) then their images will also
    touch. But \(B'\) is the image of \(B\) so we expect the image of \(q'\) -
    the given circle \(q\) - and the image of \(t_2\) - the circle sought after
    - to touch at \(B\). This is exactly what we want and thus the second required
    circle is constructed - invert \(t_2\) with respect to \(c\) with positive power: 
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ircp02.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Here is a full solution for the first case:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) \(Line(P, Q)\) until it intersects \(q(Q, R)\) at \(A\) and \(B\)
    </p>

    <p>
    2) Invert \(q\) with respect to \(c(P, PA)\) with positive power to obtain
    the circle \(q'\)
    </p>

    <p>
    3) Tangent \(t_1\) to \(q'\) at \(A\)
    </p>

    <p>
    4) Tangent \(t_2\) to \(q'\) at \(B'\)
    </p>

    <p>
    5) Invert \(t_1\) with respect to \(c\) with positive power to obtain the
    circle \(w_1\) (the first solution)
    </p>

    <p>
    6) Invert \(t_2\) with respect to \(c\) with positive power to obtain the
    circle \(w_2\) (the second solution). 
    </p>

    <p>
    You can now investigate the case when the given point \(P\) is inside \(q\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Also, now that we have looked at one solution very thoroughly we will move
    a bit faster but you should have no trouble recognizing the algorithm outlined
    at the beginning of this section.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Problem 2</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Construct all circles which are tangent to two given circles \(q_1(Q_1,
    R_1)\) and \(q_2(Q_2, R_2)\) and pass through a given point \(P\) located
    outside \(q_1\) and \(q_2\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Choose \(P\) as a center and \(c(P, r)\) as a circle of inversion with positive
    power. Assume that one required circle, \(w_1\), is somehow constructed. Under
    the inversion with respect to \(c\) with positive power circles \(q_1\) and
    \(q_2\) become circles \(q'_1\) and \(q'_2\) (<strong>ICP29</strong>) while
    the circle \(w_1\) becomes a straight line \(t_1\), based on
    <strong>ICP15</strong> for the drawing below.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since \(w_1\) touches \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) and tangency points under inversion
    are preserved, it stands to reason that the <dfn>image</dfn> of \(w_1\) will
    touch the <dfn>images</dfn> of \(q_1\) and \(q_2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    But the image of \(w_1\) is a straight line and the images of \(q_1\) and
    \(q_2\) are circles. Hence, \(t_1\) must be a tangent common to two circles,
    \(q'_1\) and \(q'_2\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ircp03.png" class="center">

    <p>
    How many common tangents do two circles can possibly have? Four - in the most
    generic case. Inverting these tangents with respect to \(c\) with positive
    power we locate our circles:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) Invert the given circles \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) with respect to \(c(P, r)\)
    with positive power to obtain the circles \(q'_1\) and \(q'_2\)
    </p>

    <p>
    2) Construct four tangents common to \(q'_1\) and \(q'_2\) - \(t_1\),
    \(t_2\), \(t_3\), \(t_4\)
    </p>

    <p>
    3) Invert \(t_1\), \(t_2\), \(t_3\), \(t_4\) with respect to \(c(P, r)\)
    with positive power to obtain the four circles sought after:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ircp04.png" class="center">

    <p>
    In the most generic case of four solution circles one will touch both given
    circles externally (\(w_1\)), one will touch both circles internally (\(w_2\)),
    and each of the two remaining circles will touch one given circle internally
    while touching the remaining one externally (\(w_3\)) and vice versa (\(w_4\)).
    </p>

    <p>
    In the drawing above we have used color and text to pair up a tangent straight
    line with its solution circle that touches both given circles. The sub indexes
    and the color match pairwise:
    </p>

$$t_1, w_1$$
$$t_2, w_2$$
$$t_3, w_3$$
$$t_4, w_4$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Problem 3</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Given three circles \(q_1\), \(q_2\) and \(q_3\), which intersect at a
    point \(P\), construct all circles which are tangent to \(q_1\), \(q_2\) and
    \(q_3\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Choose \(P\) as a center of inversion. Make the radius of inversion \(r\)
    such that \(c(P, r)\) intersects all three given circles. Under the inversion
    with respect to \(c(P, r)\) with <dfn>positive</dfn> power the given circles
    \(q_1\), \(q_2\) and \(q_3\), which pass through \(P\), will invert into the
    straight lines \(q'_1\), \(q'_2\) and \(q'_3\) (<strong>ICP15</strong>). Since
    the original circles do not touch but intersect pairwise - so will the straight
    lines. By intersecting these straight lines will delineate a triangle,
    \(\triangle LMN\) in the drawing below.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now we can construct four circles each of which is tangent to all three
    straight lines - one <dfn>incircle</dfn> and three <dfn>excircles</dfn>.
    Inverted with respect to \(c\) with positive power these circles will preserve
    their points of tangency and will become the circles sought after.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the drawing below we have constructed an <dfn>incircle</dfn>, \(w'_1\),
    and its inverse - a circle \(w_1\) that touches all three given circles
    <dfn>internally</dfn>:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ircp05.png" class="center">

    <p>
    A full solution then is:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) Invert the given circles \(q_1\), \(q_2\) and \(q_3\) with respect to
    \(c(P, r)\) with positive power to obtain the straight lines \(q'_1\), \(q'_2\)
    and \(q'_3\) which will delineate a triangle
    </p>

    <p>
    2) Construct four circles each of which is tangent to all three straight
    lines \(q'_1\), \(q'_2\) and \(q'_3\) - \(w_1\), \(w_2\), \(w_3\) and \(w_4\)
    (one <dfn>incircle</dfn> and three <dfn>excircles</dfn>)
    </p>

    <p>
    3) Invert \(w_1\), \(w_2\), \(w_3\) and \(w_4\) with respect to \(c(P, r)\)
    with positive power to obtain the four circles sought after
    </p>
 
    <p>
    In the drawing below we have used just text to pair up a circle tangent to
    \(q'_1\), \(q'_2\) and \(q'_3\) (a dashed line of one color) with its solution
    circle that touches all three given circles (a solid line of a different color).
    Only the sub indexes of each pair match while their colors differ:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ircp06.png" class="center">

$$w'_1, w_1$$
$$w'_2, w_2$$
$$w'_3, w_3$$
$$w'_4, w_4$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Problem 4</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>The Three-Circle Problem of Apollonius: construct all circles which are
    tangent to three given circles \(q_1(Q_1, R_1)\), \(q_2(Q_2, R_2)\) and
    \(q_3(Q_3, R_3)\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    The three-circle problem of Apollonius in general has eight solutions which
    can be grouped into three sets of circles. There are two circles in the first
    set - one that touches all three given circles <dfn>internally</dfn> and the
    other one that touches all three given circles <dfn>externally</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The remaining two sets of solutions have three circles each. The circles in
    one solution set touch in turn each one of the given circles
    <dfn>externally</dfn> while touching the remaining two given circles
    <dfn>internally</dfn>. The circles in the other solution set touch in turn
    each one of the given circles <dfn>internally</dfn> while touching the
    remaining two given circles <dfn>externally</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    To obtain these solutions we will employ two main ideas. The first idea is
    to reduce this problem to an already solved one - <strong>Problem 2</strong>.
    The second idea is similar to the one used in constructing tangents common
    to two circles.
    </p>

    <p>
    Without the loss of generality let us assume that:
    </p>

$$R_1 \geqslant R_2$$

    <p>
    so that when we say:
    </p>

$$R_1 - R_2$$

    <p>
    while constructing an <dfn>external</dfn> common tangent it makes geometric
    sense. The main idea here is to construct a helper circle with a radius equal
    to the difference between the larger and the smaller given radii and then
    construct a tangent \(t'\) to that circle through \(Q_2\) - the center of
    the circle with the smaller radius.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once \(t'\) is available we can construct a straight line parallel to \(t'\)
    through \(T_1\) or we can construct a perpendicular to \(Ray(Q_1, T_1)\)
    through \(T_1\) or we can construct a straight line parallel to
    \(Ray(Q_1, T_1)\) through \(Q_2\) until it intersects \(q_2\) at \(T_2\)
    and then a \(Line(T_1, T_2)\) is the common <dfn>external</dfn> tangent
    sought after. The benefit of the latter approach is that the point \(T_2\)
    is constructed explicitly:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ircp07.png" class="center">

    <p>
    1) \(Circle(Q_1, R_1 - R_2)\)
    </p>

    <p>
    2) Tangent \(t'\) to \(Circle(Q_1, R_1 - R_2)\) through \(Q_2\) to locate
    \(T'_1\)
    </p>

    <p>
    3) \(Ray(Q_1, T'_1)\) until it intersects \(q_1\) at \(T_1\)
    </p>

    <p>
    4) Line through \(Q_2\) parallel to \(Ray(Q_1, T'_1)\) until it intersects
    \(q_2\) at \(T_2\)
    </p>

    <p>
    5) \(Line(T_1, T_2)\) is the common tangent sought after
    </p>

    <p>
    For brevity sake let us call the above an "\(R_1 - R_2\)" idea. The advantage
    of this idea over the center of similitude approach is that it works even if
    \(R_1 = R_2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    To construct a common <dfn>internal</dfn> tangent construct a helper
    \(Circle(Q_1, R_1 + R_2)\) - an operation which we will call an "\(R_1 +
    R_2\)" idea for future reference:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ircp08.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Now let us go back to the problem of Apollonius. Let us first construct the
    two circles that touch all three given circles <dfn>internally</dfn> and
    <dfn>externally</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    To construct the circle that touches all three given circles
    <dfn>internally</dfn> we will use the <dfn>external</dfn> tangent common to
    two circles "\(R_1 - R_2\)" idea.
    </p>

    <p>
    Without the loss of generality let us assume that we have sorted the given
    radii in such a way that, say, \(R_3\) is the smallest: \(R_1 \geqslant R_3\)
    and \(R_2 \geqslant R_3\). Construct two intermediate helper circles -
    \(k_1(Q_1, R_1 - R_3)\) and \(k_2(Q_2, R_2 - R_3)\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Rephrase the <strong>Problem 2</strong> as:
    </p>

    <p id="dbb" class="center">
    <dfn>construct all circles which are tangent to two given circles \(k_1\) and
    \(k_2\) and pass through \(Q_3\)"</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    To solve this problem we invert the circles \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) with respect
    to \(c(Q_3, R)\) with positive power into the circles \(k'_1\) and \(k'_2\),
    construct two common <dfn>external</dfn> tangents to \(k'_1\) and \(k'_2\) -
    \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) - and invert them back with respect to \(c(Q_3, R)\) with
    positive power.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the drawing below we have constructed and inverted \(t_1\) to obtain the
    circle \(w'_1(W_1, R'_{w1})\) which passes through \(Q_3\) and touches \(k_1\)
    and \(k_2\) <dfn>internally</dfn>:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ircp09.png" class="center">

    <p>
    We see that \(w'_1\) is <dfn>almost</dfn> exactly what we want - it is
    concentric with the target circle and its radius is by \(R_3\) smaller. We
    keep the center \(W_1\) where it is, <dfn>increase</dfn> \(R'_{w1}\) by \(R_3\)
    and we have the first solution circle \(w_1\) that touches all three given
    circles <dfn>internally</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the next drawing we have constructed and inverted \(t_2\) to obtain the
    circle \(w'_2(W_2, R'_{w2})\) which passes through \(Q_3\) and touches \(k_1\)
    and \(k_2\) <dfn>externally</dfn>. We keep \(W_2\) as a center where it is,
    <dfn>decrease</dfn> \(R'_{w2}\) by \(R_3\) and we have the second solution
    circle \(w_2\) that touches all three given circles <dfn>externally</dfn>:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ircp10.png" class="center">

    <p>
    To construct the remaining six circles we will use the <dfn>internal</dfn>
    tangent common to two circles "\(R_1 + R_2\)" idea. All these circles are
    constructed in the same way so we will cover just one set of two solution
    circles and you should be able to finish the rest yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
    To make the sizes of the solution circles manageable we made the given circles
    a bit smaller this time.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us work with, say, \(q_1\). We shall construct one circle that touches
    \(q_1\) <dfn>externally</dfn> while touching \(q_2\) and \(q_3\)
    <dfn>internally</dfn> and one circle that touches \(q_1\) <dfn>internally</dfn>
    while touching \(q_2\) and \(q_3\) <dfn>externally</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Construct the circles \(k_2(Q_2, R_2 + R_1)\) and \(k_3(Q_3, R_3 + R_1)\).
    Invert them with respect to \(c(Q_1, R)\) with positive power to obtain the
    circles \(k'_2\) and \(k'_3\). Construct two external tangents common to
    \(k'_2\) and \(k'_3\) - \(t_3\) and \(t_4\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Invert \(t_3\) with respect to \(c(Q_1, R)\) with positive power to obtain
    the circle \(w'_3(W_3, R'_{w3})\) which passes through \(Q_1\) and touches
    \(k_2\) and \(k_3\) <dfn>internally</dfn>. Keep \(W_3\) as a center where it
    is, <dfn>decrease</dfn> \(R'_{w3}\) by \(R_1\) to obtain the circle \(w_3\)
    that touches \(q_1\) <dfn>externally</dfn> while touching \(q_2\) and \(q_3\)
    <dfn>internally</dfn>:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ircp11.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Invert \(t_4\) with respect to \(c(Q_1, R)\) with positive power to obtain
    the circle \(w'_4(W_4, R'_{w4})\) which passes through \(Q_1\) and touches
    \(k_2\) and \(k_3\) <dfn>externally</dfn>. Keep \(W_4\) as a center where it
    is, <dfn>increase</dfn> \(R'_{w4}\) by \(R_1\) to obtain the circle \(w_4\)
    that touches \(q_1\) <dfn>internally</dfn> while touching \(q_2\) and \(q_3\)
    <dfn>externally</dfn>:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ircp12.png" class="center">

    <p>
    That is two extra solution circles for a total of four. If we repeat the
    above process for the remaining two circles, \(q_2\) and \(q_3\), we will
    construct the remaining \(2 + 2 = 4\) circles for a total of eight.
