    <h1>Circles</h1>

    <p>
    From the properties <strong>ICP10, 11, 12, 13, 14</strong> we see that, for
    the most part, inversion with respect to a circle transforms a straight line
    into a circle that passes through the center of inversion.
    </p>
 
    <p>
    It should also be obvious that the converse statements of the above properties
    are true. We will only formulate these properties here for the record and will
    omit their proofs since they all follow the same pattern:
    </p>

    <p>
    - draw a straight line perpendicular to both circles to obtain a point \(P\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - invert \(P\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - choose a point on the given circle at random
    </p>

    <p>
    - invert that point
    </p>

    <p>
    - form triangles
    </p>

    <p>
    - use the inversion identity <strong>ICC3</strong> to prove that these
    triangles, of which one is right, are similar and hence the remaining triangle
    is right also, etc.

    </p>

    <p>
    In the upcoming properties we will look at inversions of circles into circles.
    Please note that the <dfn>center</dfn> of the original circle does
    <dfn>not</dfn> invert into the center of its image directly. However, there
    exists an interesting relationship between the two and it <dfn>is</dfn> possible
    to invert one into the other not in one but in two steps. Read more on that
    in <strong>ICE9</strong> towards the end of this tutorial.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP20</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) a circle
    \(q(O, R)\) concentric with and located inside \(c\) is transformed into a
    circle \(q'(O, R')\) concentric with and located outside \(c\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    For any point \(A\) on \(c\) from <strong>ICC3</strong> we have:
    </p>

$$OA \times OA' = r^2$$
$$OA' = \frac {r^2}{R} = const = R'$$

    <p>
    From <strong>ICP4</strong> it follows that \(A'\) must be located outside
    \(c\) and the distance from all such points to \(O\) is the same - a
    definition of a circle. The converse property is proved in the similar way
    with an obvious remark that in the drawing below under inversion with
    negative power \(A\) inverts into \(B'\), \(B\) inverts into \(A'\), and
    conversely:
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP21</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) a circle
    \(q(O, R)\) concentric with and located outside \(c\) is transformed into a
    circle \(q'(O, R')\) concentric with and located inside \(c\):</dfn>
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc22.png" class="center">

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP22</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) with positive
    power a circle \(q(Q, R)\) that does not pass through \(O\) and has exactly
    two common points with \(c\), \(F_1\) and \(F_2\), is transformed into a
    circle \(q'(Q', R')\) not passing through \(O\) but passing through \(F_1\)
    and \(F_2\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    We note right away that since \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) are on the circumference
    of \(q\), according to <strong>ICP1</strong> they are fixed and hence the
    curve into which \(q\) is transformed, whatever it is, must pass through
    these points.
    </p>

    <p>
    Next, draw Line(\(O\), \(Q\)) until it intersects \(q\) at \(A\) and \(B\).
    Invert \(A\) and \(B\) with respect to \(c\) with positive power. Pick an
    arbitrary point \(C\) on \(q\) and also invert it with respect to \(c\) with
    positive power. Consider two pairs of triangles - \(\triangle OAC\) and
    \(\triangle OC'A'\) and \(\triangle OCB\) and \(\triangle OB'C'\). From
    <strong>ICC3</strong> we have:
    </p>

$$OA \times OA' = OC \times OC' = r^2$$
$$\frac {OA}{OC} = \frac {OA'}{OC'}$$
$$OB \times OB' = OC \times OC' = r^2$$
$$\frac {OB}{OC} = \frac {OB'}{OC'}$$

    <p>
    From the first pair of equations we conclude that \(\triangle OAC\) and
    \(\triangle OC'A'\) are similar since they have two sides about the shared
    angle at \(O\) in the same proportion, <strong>B6P6</strong>. And, hence,
    these triangles have their corresponding angles equal:
    </p>

$$\angle OCA = \angle OA'C' = \alpha$$

    <p>
    From the second pair of equations we conclude that \(\triangle OCB\) and
    \(\triangle OB'C'\) are similar since they have two sides about the shared
    angle at \(O\) in the same proportion, <strong>B6P6</strong>. And, hence,
    these triangles have their corresponding angles equal:
    </p>

$$\angle OCB = \angle OB'C' = \beta$$

    <p>
    But \(\angle ACB\) is the angle in the semicircle of \(q\) and hence it is
    right (<strong>B3P31</strong>) and hence:
    </p>

$$\angle OCB = \alpha + 90^{\circ} = \beta$$

    <p>
    Next, we note that \(\angle OB'C'\) is exterior for \(\triangle B'C'A'\) and
    hence, (<strong>B1P32</strong>):
    </p>

$$\angle OB'C' = \beta = x + \alpha$$

    <p>
    And from the previous equation we have:
    </p>

$$\beta = x + \alpha = \alpha + 90^{\circ}$$
$$x = 90^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    And since \(C\) was picked at random, the locus traced by \(C'\) must be a
    circumference of a circle with \(B'A'\) as its diameter:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc23.png" class="center">

    <p>
    This suggests the following straight edge and compass construction:
    </p>
 
    <p>
    1) Line(\(O\), \(Q\)) until it intersects \(q\) at \(A\)
    </p>

    <p>
    2) Invert \(A\) with respect to \(c\) with positive power to locate \(A'\)
    </p>

    <p>
    3) LineSegment(\(F_1\), \(A'\)) bisector \(s\) until it intersects
    Line(\(O\), \(Q\)) at \(Q'\)
    </p>

    <p>
    4) Circle(\(Q'\), \(Q'F_1 = Q'A'\)) = \(q'\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc24.png" class="center">

    <p>
    The proof of the above property, <strong>ICP22</strong>, is a template for
    proofs for all the remaining properties which we will only formulate for the
    record and highlight their key triangles. You are encouraged to go through
    the actual proofs yourself.

    <p>
    Again, verbally this property sounds the same for inversions with positive
    and negative powers. The only difference between them is the location of the
    image \(q'\). For an inversion with positive power \(q'\) and \(c\) are on
    the same side of \(O\) and for an inversion with negative power they are on
    the opposite sides of \(O\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Here is a drawing for an inversion with negative power. You are encouraged
    to explore the positive power case yourself:

    </p>

    <p id="dbg">

    does not pass through \(O\), has zero common points with and is located

    </p>

    <p>
    This property is just a converse of <strong>ICP28</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP30</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>If \(q'(Q', R')\) is a circle inverse to \(q(Q, R)\) under the inversion
    with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) and \(d = OQ\) then:</dfn>
    </p>

$$R' = R \frac {r^2}{|d^2 - R^2|}$$

    <p>
    Let us prove this property for an inversion with positive power:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc33.png" class="center">

    <p>
    From the drawing above it is obvious that:
    </p>

$$R' = \frac {OA' - OB'}{2}$$
$$OA' = \frac {r^2}{OA}, OB' = \frac {r^2}{OB}$$
$$R' = \frac {r^2}{2} \Big(\frac {1}{OA} - \frac {1}{OB}\Big) = \frac {r^2}{2}
\frac {OB - OA}{OA \times OB}$$
$$OA = d - R, OB = d + R$$
$$R' = \frac {r^2}{2} \frac {d + R - d + R}{(d - R)(d + R)} = \frac {r^2}{2}
\frac {2R}{d^2 - R^2} = R \frac {r^2}{d^2 - R^2}$$

    <p>
    When \(O\) is inside \(q\) (not shown in the drawing) then:
    </p>

$$OA = R - d$$

    <p>
    which means that we should use the absolute value of the difference of
    squares:
    </p>

$$R' = R \frac {r^2}{|d^2 - R^2|}$$

    <p>
    You can verify this property for inversion with negative power and various
    other configurations of circles yourself.
