    <h1>Angles</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Definition ICD2</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>An angle between two curves at a point \(T\) is an angle between the
    tangents to both curves at a point \(T\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP31</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) the angle
    between two straight lines \(l_1\) and \(l_2\), both of which pass through
    \(O\), is equal to the angle between their images \(l'_1\) and
    \(l'_2\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    According to <strong>ICP9</strong> both straight lines \(l_1\) and \(l_2\)
    are transformed into themselves and, hence, the angle between them is equal
    to the angle between their images \(l'_1\) and \(l'_2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP32</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) the angle
    between two straight lines \(l_1\) and \(l_2\), of which exactly one passes
    through \(O\), is equal to the angle between their images \(l'_1\) and
    \(l'_2\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Without the loss of generality let us assume that \(l_1\) passes through
    \(O\) and from <strong>ICP9</strong> it follows then that its image with
    respect to \(c\) also passes through \(O\) and coincides with \(l_1\). From
    the properties <strong>ICP10-14</strong> it follows then that \(l_2\) is
    transformed into a circle \(l'_2\) that passes through \(O\). From
    <strong>ICD2</strong> it follows that the angle between \(l'_1\) and
    \(l'_2\) is the angle between the straight line \(l'_1\) and the tangent
    \(t\) to \(l'_2\) at \(O\).
    </p>
 
    <p>
    Let us look at an inversion with positive power and consider three cases:
    \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) are parallel, perpendicular, neither.
    </p>
 
    <p>
    <strong>Case 1</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    When \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) are parallel then the angle between them is zero 
    degrees and the tangent \(t\) to \(l'_2\) at \(O\) is parallel to \(l_2\)
    (<strong>B1P27</strong>). We then have two parallel straight lines, \(l'_1\)
    and \(t\), passing through one point \(O\) which means that they must coincide
    which makes the angle between them also zero degrees, thus preserving it: 
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc34.png" class="center">

    <p>
    <strong>Case 2</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    When \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) are perpendicular then \(O\), \(A\), \(A'\) and \(Q'\),
    by the properties <strong>ICP10-14</strong>, are all located on \(l'_1\).
    Hence, the diameter \(OQ'A'\) of \(l'_2\) is also located on \(l'_1\).
    </p>

    <p>
    By <strong>B1P27</strong>, if a straight line falling on two straight lines
    makes the alternate angles equal then the two straigt lines are parallel,
    both tangents to \(l'_2\), \(t\) at \(O\) and \(t'\) at \(A'\), are parallel
    since the corresponding angles between the diameter \(OQ'A'\) and \(t\) and
    \(t'\) are right by definition of a tangent.
    </p>

    <p>
    By the same <strong>B1P27</strong> we prove that \(t\) is prallel to \(l_2\)
    and \(t'\) is parallel to \(l_2\) making all three straight lines \(t, t',
    l_2\) parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
    Lastly, because the above straight lines are parallel, by <strong>B1P29</strong>,
    a straight line (\(l_1 = l'_1\)) falling on two parallel straight lines (\(t\)
    and \(t'\)) makes the alternate angles equal to one another, it follows that
    \(t\) and \(t'\) are perpendicular to \(l'_1\) which preserves the angle
    between \(l_1\) and \(l_2\): 
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc35.png" class="center">

    <p>
    <strong>Case 3</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    When \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) are neither parallel nor perpendicular then we
    consider the smaller angle between them as \(\alpha\). The tangent \(t\) to
    \(l'_2\) at \(O\) is parallel to \(l_2\) (<strong>B1P27</strong>). It follows
    then that a straight line \(l'_1\) is falling on two parallel straight lines
    \(t\) and \(l_2\). From <strong>B1P29</strong> it follows that:
    </p>

$$\angle BOA = \alpha$$

    <p>
    thus preserving the angle between \(l'_1\) and \(l'_2\) at \(O\):
    </p>
 
    <img src="imgs/irc36.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Consider the angle between the second tangent, \(t'\), and \(l'_1\) at \(A\).
    By construction (and the definition of a tangent) \(\angle Q'AB\) and \(\angle
    Q'OB\) are right and:
    </p>

$$Q'A = Q'O$$

    <p>
    (being the radii of \(l'_2\)). Hence, the right triangles \(Q'AB\) and \(Q'OB\),
    by Pythagoras, have:
    </p>

$$BA = BO$$

    <p>
    (\(BQ'\) being a common hypotenuse). Hence, \(\triangle OBA\) is isosceles
    having its interior angles at the base \(OA\) equal (<strong>B1P5</strong>).
    Hence:
    </p>

$$\angle BAO = \angle BOA = \alpha$$

    <p>
    and the angle between \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) is also preserved.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP33</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) the angle between
    two straight lines \(l_1\) and \(l_2\), none of which pass through \(O\), is
    equal to the angle between their images \(l'_1\) and \(l'_2\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Again, let us look at an inversion with positive power and consider three cases:
    \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) are parallel, perpendicular, neither. Let \(P\) be the
    second point of intersection of \(l'_1\) and \(l'_2\). Let \(t_1\) and
    \(t'_1\) be tangents to \(l'_1\) at \(O\) and \(P\). Let \(t_2\) and \(t'_2\)
    be tangents to \(l'_2\) at \(O\) and \(P\).
    </p>
 
    <p>
    <strong>Case 1</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    When \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) are parallel then the angle between them is zero
    degrees. By <strong>B1P27</strong> the tangent \(t_1\) to \(l'_1\) at \(O\)
    is parallel to \(l_1\) and the tangent \(t_2\) to \(l'_2\) at \(O\) is
    parallel to \(l_2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    But it is given that \(l_1\) is parallel to \(l_2\) and hence \(t_2\), for
    example, is parallel to \(l_1\). From <strong>B1P30</strong>, straight lines
    (\(t_1, t_2\)) parallel to the same straight line (\(l_1\)) are parallel to
    one another, it follows that \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) are parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
    But since \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) both pass through \(O\), it follows that they
    coincide making the angle between them also zero degrees, thus preserving it: 
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc37.png" class="center">

    <p>
    <strong>Case 2</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    When \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) are perpendicular then together with \(t_1\), which
    is parallel to \(l_1\) (<strong>B1P27</strong>) and \(t_2\), which is parallel
    to \(l_2\) (<strong>B1P27</strong>), they form a parallelogram. Hence, from
    <strong>B1P34</strong> (in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and
    angles equal one another), it follows that \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) are also
    perpendicular. In the previous property, <strong>ICP32</strong>, we've proved
    that \(\triangle OQ'_1P\) and \(\triangle OQ'_2P\) are isosceles. Hence:
    </p>
 
$$90^{\circ} = \alpha + \beta$$
 
    <p>
    must be true at both vertexes, \(O\) and \(P\), thus proving that the angle
    between \(t'_1\) and \(t'_2\) is preserved: 
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc38.png" class="center">

    <p>
    <strong>Case 3</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    When \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) are neither parallel nor perpendicular then we
    consider the smaller angle between them as \(\alpha\). As in the previous
    (perpendicular) case we prove that the angle between \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) is
    \(\alpha\) (the opposite angles in the parallelogrammic areas argument).
    However, this time the tangents to circles intersect not at their centers but
    elsewhere - at the points \(A\) and \(B\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/irc39.png" class="center">

    <p>
    Still, by construction \(\triangle Q'_1OB\) and \(\triangle Q'_1PB\) are
    right. They have a common hypotenuse \(Q'_1B\) and two equal sides, \(Q'_1O
    = Q'_1P\), since these are the radii of \(l'_1\). By Pythagoras \(BP = BO\).
    Hence, \(\triangle OBP\) is isosceles having its interior angles at the base
    \(OP\) equal, \(\gamma\). In a similar way we can prove that \(AP = AO\), 
    \(\triangle OAP\) is isosceles having its interior angles at the base \(OP\)
    equal, \(\beta\). Hence:
    </p>
 
$$\alpha = \beta + \gamma$$
 
    <p>
    proving that the angle between \(t'_1\) and \(t'_2\) is also preserved.
    </p>

    <p>
    From <strong>ICD2</strong> and the above angle preservation properties for
    straight lines two more properties follow:
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP34</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) the angle between
    a straight line \(l\) and a circle \(q\) is equal to the angle between their
    images \(l'\) and \(q'\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Property ICP35</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>Under the inversion with respect to a circle \(c(O, r)\) the angle between
    two circles \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) is equal to the angle between their images
    \(q'_1\) and \(q'_2\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>We will omit the proofs of these properties but your are encouraged to
    construct them yourself nonetheless.
