    <h1>sss: side, side, side</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Given</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) - all three sides of a triangle with a stipulation that
    the sum of any two sides is greater than the remaining one:
    </p>

$$a + b > c$$
$$a + c > b$$
$$c + b > a$$

    <p>
    This is an all time classic - Euclid carries out this construction in
    <strong>B1P22</strong> which itself is a generalization of
    <strong>B1P1</strong> - an equilateral triangle construction.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Analysis</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We start with an observation that three vertexes are needed to construct a
    triangle. In this particular case we can locate two vertexes by choosing an
    arbitrary given side and cutting its length on an arbitrary line. We can then
    use these vertexes as centers of circles built with the remaining sides as
    their radii to locate the third vertex of the triangle. These circles will
    intersect at two points but one is enough.
    </p>

    <p>
    For this construction to work two postulates missing from Euclid's
    <dfn>"Elements"</dfn> are needed. The first one should state:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg" class="center">
    <dfn>if the distance between the centers of two circles is less than the sum
    and greater than the difference of their radii then these two circles
    intersect</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    The second postulate should state:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg" class="center">
    <dfn>two straight lines intersect at one point at the most</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    The first postulate gives the intersecting circles the right to exist and
    spells out the conditions under which this event can occur. In the construction
    below this postulate gives the right for the point \(A\) (and its counterpart)
    to exist. The second postulate is needed to ensure that the straight lines
    on which the radii of the circle lie intersect at exactly point \(A\) and
    nowhere else.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Construction Outline</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>Construct the given side \(a\) at the vertexes \(C\) and \(B\).
    Construct a \(Cir(C, b)\) and a \(Cir(B, c)\). The intersection of
    these two circles locates \(A\)</dfn>
    </p>
