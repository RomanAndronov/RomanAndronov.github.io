    <h1>sSOsa: side, Sum Of sides, angle</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Given</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    \(a\), \(b + c\), \(\angle A\) - one side, the sum of the remaining two sides
    and the non-included angle
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Analysis</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us assume that the required triangle \(ABC\) has been constructed. From
    <strong>ECons</strong> we now how to construct the sum of two line segments.
    However, since the sides of the assumed triangle are known, all we need to do
    is extend the line segment \(CA\) and construct a \(Cir(A, c)\) which will
    intersect the \(CA\)'s extension at the point \(D\) such that the length of
    the line segment \(CD\) will be equal to the given sum of the sides \(b\) and
    \(c\).
    </p>

    <p>
    The points \(A\), \(B\) and \(D\) form an isosceles triangle \(DAB\)
    because its two sides, \(AD\) and \(AB\), being the radii of the
    \(Cir(A, c)\), are equal to each other:
    </p>

    <p>
    Next, we observe that the given angle \(A\), \(\angle CAB\) in the drawing,
    is the external angle for \(\triangle DAB\) and according to
    <strong>B1P32</strong>:
    </p>

$$\angle CAB = \angle ABD + \angle ADB$$

    <p>
    But the angles \(ABD\) and \(ADB\) are equal because they are the angles at
    the base of the isosceles triangle \(DAB\) (<strong>B1P5</strong>). Hence:
    </p>

$$\angle CAB = 2 \times \angle ADB$$
$$\angle ADB = \frac {\angle CAB}{2} = \frac {\angle A}{2}$$

    <p>
    Since two halves make up one whole, if we construct an angle \(BDZ\) such
    that:
    </p>

$$\angle BDZ = \angle ADB$$

    <p>
    then we will have:
    </p>

$$\angle ADZ = \angle A$$

    <p>
    which means that \(DB\) and \(\angle ADZ\)'s bisector coincide. Hence, the
    second vertex of the required triangle, \(B\), (\(C\) being the first one),
    must be located somewhere on that bisector.
    </p>

    <p>
    In an attempt to locate the second vertex \(B\) by constructing a
    \(Cir(C, a)\) we observe that three outcomes are possible:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) \(Cir(C, a)\) may <dfn>intersect</dfn> the angle bisector at two points,
    \(B\) and \(B_1\)
    </p>

    <p>
    2) \(Cir(C, a)\) may <dfn>touch</dfn> the angle bisector at one point,
    \(B_2\)
    </p>

    <p>
    3) \(Cir(C, a)\) may not even reach the angle bisector at all
    </p>

    <p>
    In the first two cases we notice that from the definition of \(Cir(A, c)\)
    it follows that the vertex \(A\) is equidistant from \(D\) and whatever the
    second vertex may be, \(B\) for example. The locus of all such points is
    \(DB\)'s perpendicular bisector whose intersection with the given line
    segment \(b + c\) locates \(A\).
    </p>

    <p>
    From the right triangle \(CB_2D\) it follows that if:
    </p>

$$\sin \frac {A}{2} < \frac {a}{b + c}$$

    <p>
    then it is possible to construct two triangles.
    </p>

    <p>
    If:
    </p>

$$\sin \frac {A}{2} = \frac {a}{b + c}$$

    <p>
    then it is possible to construct one (right) triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
    If:
    </p>

$$\sin \frac {A}{2} > \frac {a}{b + c}$$

    <p>
    then a triangle construction is impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note the similarity between this and the <strong>sDOsa</strong> construction
    with the exception that in the latter case we bisect the angle supplementary
    to the given one - not the angle itself.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Construction Outline</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>Construct the given line segment \(b + c\) at the vertexes \(C\) and
    \(D\). Construct the given angle \(A\) with the vertex at the point \(D\)
    and bisect it. Construct a \(Cir(C, a)\). That circle may conditionally
    intersect the \(\angle A\)'s bisector, it may touch it or it may not reach
    it. The intersection locates two vertexes, \(B_1\) and \(B_2\), of two
    possible triangles. The single point of tangency locates one vertex, \(B\),
    of one possible (right) triangle. Bisect the line segment formed by the
    vertex \(D\) on one side and the point \(B\) or \(B_1\) or \(B_2\) on the
    other. The intersection of that bisector with the given line segment
    \(b + c\) locates \(A\)</dfn>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Sample Construction</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Below is a sample construction of two triangles when:
    </p>

$$\sin \frac {A}{2} < \frac {a}{b + c}$$
