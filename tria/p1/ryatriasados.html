    <h1>saDOs: side, angle, Difference Of sides</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Given</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    \(a\), \(\angle C\), \(b - c\) or \(c - b\) - one side, the included
    angle and the difference of the remaining two sides
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Analysis</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Since a difference of two linear magnitudes is given, it follows that two
    cases must be considered:
    </p>

$$c > b$$
$$b > c$$

    <p>
    <strong>Case 1: \(c > b\)</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    The side opposite to the given angle is greater than the adjacent side.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us assume that the required triangle \(ABC\) has been constructed. From
    <strong>ECons</strong> we know how to construct the difference between two
    line segments. However, since the sides of the assumed triangle are known,
    all we need to do is construct a \(Cir(A, c)\) which will intersect the
    extended side \(AC\) at the point \(D\) marking the given linear difference
    between \(c\) and \(b\):
    </p>

    <p>
    Working in reverse order, given the points \(D\) and \(B\), how do we locate
    the center of the \(Cir(A, c)\)?
    </p>

    <p>
    By the definition of that circle:
    </p>

$$AD = AB = c$$

    <p>
    which means that the point \(A\) is equidistant from the points \(D\) and
    \(B\). The locus of all such points is \(DB\)'s perpendicular bisector which
    will intersect the side of the given angle \(C\) opposite to the given side
    \(a\) at the remaining vertex, \(A\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Construction Outline</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>Construct the given side \(a\) at the vertexes \(C\) and \(B\).
    Construct the given angle \(C\) with the vertex at the point \(C\). Cut the
    given difference of the sides \(c - b\) at \(C\) and \(D\) on the
    <strong>extension</strong> of the side of the given angle \(C\) opposite to
    the given side \(a\). Bisect the line segment \(DB\). The intersection of
    that bisector with the side of the given angle \(C\) opposite to the given
    side \(a\) locates \(A\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Case 2: \(b > c\)</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    The side adjacent to the given angle is greater than the opposite side.
    </p>

    <p>
    This case is almost identical to the previous one except that since \(b\) is
    greater than \(c\) the \(Cir(A, c)\) will cut the linear difference between
    them inside the line segment \(CA\) or within the side \(b\) itself - not
    its extension as in the \(c > b\) case:
    </p>

    <br><strong>Construction Outline</strong>

    <p>
    <dfn>Construct the given side \(a\) at the vertexes \(C\) and \(B\).
    Construct the given angle \(C\) with the vertex at the point \(C\). Cut the
    given difference of the sides \(c - b\) at \(C\) and \(D\) on the side of
    the given angle \(C\) opposite to the given side \(a\). Bisect the line
    segment \(DB\). The intersection of that bisector with the side of the given
    angle \(C\) opposite to the given side \(a\) locates \(A\)</dfn>

    Below is the \(b > c\) case construction. You are encouraged to do the
    \(c > b\) case yourself:

$$C, Z$$
$$Ln(C, Z)$$
$$Cir(C, a)$$
$$Cir(C, a) \; \cap \; Ln(C, Z) = B \colon \quad CB = a$$
$$Y \colon \quad \angle YCB = \angle C$$
$$Ln(C, Y)$$
$$Cir(C, b - c)$$
$$Cir(C, b - c) \; \cap \; Ln(C, Y) = D \colon \quad CD = b - c$$
$$Ln(D, B)$$
$$K, L, M \colon \quad Ln(K, M) \; \cap \; Ln(D, B) = L \colon \quad LD = LB$$
$$Ln(K, M) \; \cap \; Ln(C, Y) = A \colon \quad AC = b, AB = c$$
$$Ln(A, B)$$
$$\triangle ABC$$
