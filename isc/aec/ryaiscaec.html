    <h1>
    Arithmetic Expressions Calculator (AEC)
    </h1>

    <p>
    as a whole is a machine that acts on arbitrary, properly syntaxed arithmetic
    expressions of finite length.
    </p>

    <p>
    In its simplest traditional form a legal arithmetic expression is a collection
    of arithmetic operators and operands. Operands are also called <dfn>operator's
    arguments</dfn> or just <dfn>arguments</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Operands</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We will start with non-negative integer operands:
    </p>

$$0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$$

    <p>
    and the following
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Operators</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">+ (addition), ASCII decimal 43
- (subtraction), ASCII decimal 45
* (multiplication), ASCII decimal 42
/ (division), ASCII decimal 47
% (modulus), ASCII decimal 37</p>

    <p>
    Every operator has an attribute called <dfn>arity</dfn> that reflects the
    number of operands or arguments an operator acts on.
    </p>

    <p>
    Operators that act on a single argument are called <dfn>unary</dfn> and such
    operators are abound in the C programming language, for example: increment
    (<span id="inlncode">++</span>), decrement (<span id="inlncode">--</span>),
    address of (<span id="inlncode">&</span>),
    dereference (<span id="inlncode">*</span>), one's complement
    (<span id="inlncode">~</span>), etc.
    </p>

    <p>
    Operators that act on a pair of arguments are called <dfn>binary</dfn>. All
    the arithmetic operators in the above list are binary.
    </p>

    <p>
    Operators that act on three arguments are called <dfn>tertiary</dfn> and so
    on.
    </p>

    <p>
    An operator is <dfn>executed</dfn> when the action that it prescribes is
    taken against its arguments and a numerical, in our case, result is produced,
    output or recorded. For example, an execution of the addition operator in
    the following expression:
    </p>

$$1 + 2$$

    <p>
    produces the following result: \(3\). Once a result of operator's execution
    is obtained, it is permissible to replace the original expression, \(1+2\),
    with that result, \(3\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Direction</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Textual (symbolic) information, represented as a linear container, may be
    processed (parsed) in two logical directions: left to right and right to
    left. It is a Western tradition to use the former. To give such words as
    <span id="inlncode">left, first, right, last, before, after</span> and the
    like an unambiguous meaning we shall adapt the following convention.
    </p>

    <p>
    The concept of <dfn>reference frame</dfn> is defined in physics as an
    arbitrary coordinate system, rectangular, polar, spherical, cylindrical,
    etc., and a clock. For the purposes of this, computer science, discussion
    we shall lose the clock and keep a simplified, one-dimensional, coordinate
    system in a form of a straight line with a fixed origin point \(O\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/aec01.png" class="center">

    <p>
    The above qualifiers then are <dfn>relative</dfn> - they become meaningful
    when at least two arbitrary items are temporarily fixed. For example, between
    items \(a\) and \(b\) the item \(a\) is <dfn>left, first, before</dfn> and
    <dfn>prior</dfn> while the item \(b\) is <dfn>right, last, after</dfn> and
    <dfn>post</dfn>. However, if we move away from the origin then in the
    \(\{b,c\}\) pair, for example, the item \(b\) is left, first, before and prior
    while the item \(c\) is right, last, after and post. In the \(\{c,d\}\) pair
    the item \(c\) is left and first while the item \(d\) is right and last and
    so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    Find the similarity between the concepts of <dfn>directionality</dfn> and
    <dfn>order</dfn> or <dfn>order relation</dfn> taught in computer science and
    various mathematics courses: Number Theory, Discrete Mathematics, Formal
    Logic, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Notation</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    is a mechanism used to record a given arithmetic expression by fixing the
    position of an operator relative to its operand(s). The three popular
    notations are <dfn>infix, prefix</dfn> and <dfn>postfix</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Infix Notation</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    places a binary operator between its operands:
    </p>

$$1 + 2$$
$$3 - 4$$
$$5 \times 6$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Prefix Notation</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    places an operator before or prior to its operands (if a logical left to
    right order of expression's processing is used, see Direction section above).
    The previous expressions rendered in an infix notation are recorded in a prefix
    notation as follows:
    </p>

$$+12$$
$$-34$$
$$\times 56$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Postfix Notation</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    places an operator after or post its operands (if a logical left to right
    order of expression's processing is used, see Direction section above).
    The previous expressions rendered in an infix notation are recorded in a
    postfix notation as follows:
    </p>

$$12+$$
$$34-$$
$$56 \times $$

    <p>
    Observe that with prefix and postfix notations the need for boundaries between
    operands becomes necessary as it is not clear what does \(123+\), for example,
    actually mean - is it \(1+23\) or \(12+3\)?
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Collisions</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In an expression written in an infix notation two operators may collide -
    share an argument:
    </p>

$$E = 1 + 2 \times 3$$

    <p>
    In \(E\) it is not entirely obvious which operator should be executed first -
    addition, acting on \(1\) and \(2\), or multiplication, acting on \(2\) and
    \(3\)?
    </p>

    <p>
    Every operator has an attribute called <dfn>precedence</dfn> that is used
    to resolve collisions of the above type - between two colliding operators the
    one with a higher precedence is executed first.
    </p>

    <p>
    Sorting the list of our operators in descending precedence order, from
    highest to lowest, we obtain:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">multiplication, division, modulus
addition, subtraction</p>

    <p>
    At least initially, an operator should have only one (and constant)
    precedence level.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the table above multiple operators have the same precedence. When two such
    operators collide:
    </p>

$$1 + 2 - 3$$

    <p>
    it is not entirely obvious which operator should be executed first.
    </p>

    <p>
    Every operator has an attribute called <dfn>associativity</dfn> that is used
    to resolve collisions of operators that have the same precedence. In addition
    to the word <dfn>associativity</dfn> another two terms are sometimes used:
    <dfn>recursion</dfn> and <dfn>grouping</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    When a decision is made that multiple colliding operators of the same
    precedence should be executed left to right - meaning that the the left-most
    operator should be executed first - then such operators are called
    left-associative, left-recursive, grouping left to right or just grouping
    left.
    </p>

    <p>
    When a decision is made that multiple colliding operators of the same
    precedence should be executed right to left - meaning that the the right-most
    operator should be executed first - then such operators are called
    right-associative, right-recursive, grouping right to left or just grouping
    right.
    </p>

    <p>
    At least initially, all the operators with the same precedence should have
    only one (and constant, and the same) associativity type.
    </p>

    <p>
    An exponentiation operator, <span id="inlncode">^</span>, ASCII decimal
    \(94\), is an example of a right-associative operator:
    </p>

$$2 \wedge 3 \wedge 2 = 2 \wedge_2 3 \wedge_1 2 = 2 \wedge 9 = 512$$

    <p>
    All our operators, however, are left-associative. As such:
    </p>

$$9 - 4 + 1 = 9 -_1 4 +_2 1 = 6$$
$$4 \div 2 \times 3 = 4 \div_1 2 \times_2 3 = 6$$

    <p>
    In the sample expressions above we have used sub indexes to indicate the
    order of operators' execution.
    </p>

    <p>
    These (silly) examples demonstrate that an infix notation is begging for
    generosity with (invasive)
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>OOEMs</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    or Order Of Execution Modifiers. To help us say what we mean and bend an
    expression rendered in an infix form to our will a special type of operator
    is used - parenthesis (traditionally).
    </p>

    <p>
    To designate a left-hand side of order of execution modification we will
    use a left parenthesis, <span id="inlncode">(</span>, ASCII decimal \(40\).
    To designate a right-hand side of order of execution modification we will
    use a right parenthesis, <span id="inlncode">)</span>, ASCII decimal \(41\).
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, according to the previously described precedence rules, the
    following expression:
    </p>

$$1 + 2 \times 3$$

    <p>
    yields \(7\). However, if addition is to be executed first, the same
    expression should be augmented as follows:
    </p>

$$( 1 + 2 ) \times 3$$

    <p>
    yielding \(9\).
    </p>

    <p>
    If multiple parenthesis are used to modify the order of execution of multiple
    operators then the operator located in the innermost parenthesis is executed
    first. In a sample expression below we again use sub indexes to designate the
    order of operators' execution:
    </p>

$$((1 + 2) \times 3 + 4) \times 5 =$$
$$((1 +_1 2) \times_2 3 +_3 4) \times_4 5 =$$
$$(3 \times_1 3 +_2 4) \times_3 5 =$$
$$(9 +_1 4) \times_2 5 =$$
$$13 \times_1 5 = 65$$

    <p>
    Observe that the algorithmicity of the above computational process becomes
    evident: we use the process mentioned in Operators section - replace an
    expression with its result and, in our case, repeat.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before moving on to the Shunting Yard algorithm proper we observe that the
    remaining notations, prefix and postfix, are parenthesis-free. It means that
    with these notations:
    </p>

    <p class="center">
    <dfn>the physical location of an operator within the expression (container)
    is equated to the order of its execution</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Put another way, prefix and postfix are "execute when encountered" notations.
    For example, the following expression rendered in an infix form
    as:
    </p>

$$1 + 2 \times 3$$

    <p>
    renders in a prefix notation as:
    </p>

$$+1 \times 23$$

    <p>
    and in a postfix form as:
    </p>

$$123 \times +$$

    <p>
    Correspondingly, a parenthesised expression captured in an infix notation:
    </p>

$$(1 + 2) \times 3$$

    <p>
    renders in a prefix form as:
    </p>

$$\times +123$$

    <p>
    and in a postfix form as:
    </p>

$$12+3 \times$$

    <p>
    We do not know how to compute the values of expressions in prefix and postfix
    forms yet but we should understand how to convert an expression in an infix
    notation into its equivalent in either prefix or postfix form manually.
    </p>

    <p>
    One way to do that is to use the method of substitution. Let \(E_{in}\) stand
    for an expression rendered in an infix notation, \(E_{pr}\) stand for an
    expression rendered in a prefix form and \(E_{po}\) stand for an expression
    rendered in a postfix form. To convert the following sample expression rendered
    in an infix notation:
    </p>

$$(1 + 2) \times 3$$

    <p>
    to its prefix and postfix equivalents follow these steps:
    </p>

$$E_{in} = (1 + 2) \times 3$$
$$(1 + 2) = \omega$$
$$E_{in} = \omega \times 3$$
$$E_{pr} = \times \omega 3$$
$$\omega = (1 + 2)_{in} = +12_{pr}$$
$$E_{pr} = \times +123$$
$$E_{po} = \omega 3 \times$$
$$\omega = (1 + 2)_{in} = 12+_{po}$$
$$E_{po} = 12+ 3 \times$$

    <p>
    The above method is borrowed verbatim from Mathematical Analysis where it
    is used to compute derivatives of composite functions:
    </p>

$$\cos'(\sin(x))$$
$$\sin(x) = \omega$$
$$\cos'(\omega) = - \sin(\omega) \times \omega'$$
$$\omega' = \sin'(x) = \cos(x)$$
$$\cos'(\sin(x)) = - \sin(\sin(x)) \times \cos(x)$$

    <p>
    This substitution method is not entirely computational - it mimics a way a
    human would perform these tasks with pen and paper. Our goal, however, is
    automation - the heart and soul of the Shunting Yard algorithm whose inner
    workings we shall understand in depth by the end of this tutorial.
    </p>

    <p>
    Nonetheless, it is profitable to spend a certain amount of time practicing
    manual conversions of expressions rendered in an infix notation to their
    prefix and postfix equivalents before moving on - be able to convert simple
    expressions in your mind, without pen and paper.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, it should be clear why:
    </p>

$$if \quad E_{in} = 1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * (5 + 6 * (7 + 8))) \quad then$$
$$E_{pr} = +1*2+3*4+5*6+78$$
$$E_{po} = 12345678+*+*+*+$$

    <p>
    In the expression below we have numbered the like operators in a left to
    right fashion to make them unique:
    </p>

$$E_{in} = 1 +_1 2 *_1 (3 +_2 4 *_2 (5 +_3 6 *_3 (7 +_4 8)))$$

    <p>
    To convince yourself that you understand the manual conversion process find
    the corresponding operators in the expressions rendered in prefix and postfix
    forms:
    </p>

$$E_{pr} = +_?1*_?2+_?3*_?4+_?5*_?6+_?78$$
$$E_{po} = 12345678+_?*_?+_?*_?+_?*_?+_?$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Shunting Yard Algorithm</strong>
    <p>

    <p>
    invented by the Dutch computer scientist (and a theoretical physicist by
    education) Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1961, is a two-pass rearrange-then-compute
    algorithm used to calculate the values of expressions in an infix form by
    first converting them into a prefix or postfix form (or an abstract syntax
    tree - not discussed here) and then computing the result.
    </p>

    <p>
    In our implementation algorithm's both passes use two types of restrictive
    linear containers known as <dfn>queue</dfn> and <dfn>stack</dfn> - one
    container of each type. Queues and stacks impose limitations on a way
    a linear container is populated and vacated - new items can be added to and
    existing items can be removed from such a container only via its extremities.
    </p>

    <p>
    In a queue new items are added to one extremity while the existing items are
    removed from the opposite extremity. This type of container's population
    control effectively removes an item that was added to a container least
    recently.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, assume that three items, \(1, 2, 3\), were added to a queue
    in that order without any intervening removal requests. Logically such a queue
    may be represented as an abstract array of unspecified size as follows:
    </p>

$$[3][2][1]$$

    <p>
    A request to remove one item from the above container will result in a removal
    of item \(1\), since it is a least recently added item, after which a container
    will have the following contents:
    </p>

$$[3][2]$$

    <p>
    In an abbreviated from queues are sometimes called <dfn>FIFO</dfn> containers,
    where FIFO stands for First In First Out.
    </p>

    <p>
    In a stack, on the other hand, new items are added to and existing items are
    removed from a container via the same extremity. This type of container's
    population control effectively removes an item that was added to a container
    most recently.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, assume that the same three items were added to a stack in the
    same order without any intervening removal requests. Logically such a stack
    may be represented as an abstract array of unspecified size as follows:
    </p>

$$[3][2][1]$$

    <p>
    A request to remove one item from the above container will result in a removal
    of item \(3\), since it is a most recently added item, after which a container
    will have the following contents:
    </p>

$$[2][1]$$

    <p>
    In an abbreviated from stacks are sometimes called <dfn>LIFO</dfn> containers,
    where LIFO stands for Last In First Out.
    </p>

    <p>
    We observe in passing that a queue's extremities are sometimes labeled as
    <dfn>head</dfn> and <dfn>tail</dfn> while a stack's only operational
    extremity is sometimes labeled as <dfn>top</dfn> for ease of reference.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Conversion</strong>
    <p>

    <p>
    of an input arithmetic expression rendered in an infix form into its equivalent
    rendered in a prefix or postfix form (or an abstract syntax tree) is the purpose
    of the first pass of the Shunting Yard algorithm through its input.
    <p>

    <p>
    From now on we assume that \(Q_{in}\) is an input queue that contains an input
    arithmetic expression rendered in an infix notation, \(S\) is a stack,
    \(Q_{pr}\) is an output queue that contains the arithmetic expression rendered
    in a prefix form and \(Q_{po}\) is an output queue that contains the arithmetic
    expression rendered in a postfix form.
    <p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Whole Pass, At Once</strong>
    <p>

    <p>
    In the first, conversion, pass a stack is used to temporarily store only
    operators while a queue is used to store operands and operators effectively
    rendering an input expression in the requested form - prefix or postfix.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here is an outline of the conversion algorithm in a much simplified form:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">while ( input items remain )
{
	obtain next input item
	if ( item is an operand )
		add operand to output queue
	else
		add operator to stack
}

while ( stack not empty )
{
	remove operator from stack
	add operator to output queue
}</p>

    <p>
    The above algorithm is output notation-neutral - it can be used to convert
    an input expression rendered in an infix form into its equivalent in a prefix
    or postfix notation.
    </p>

    <p>
    To convert an expression rendered in an infix form into its equivalent in a:
    </p>

    <p>
    - prefix form: read the input and write the output right to left starting
    from the right-most input/output position
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/aec02.png" class="center">

    <p>
    - postfix form: read the input and write the output left to right starting
    from the left-most input/output position
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Sample Calculation</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Infix to Prefix:</strong>
    </p>

$$E_{in} = 1 + 2$$
$$Q_{in} = [1][+][2]$$
$$Q_{pr} = [2]$$
$$S = [+]$$
$$Q_{pr} = [1][2]$$
$$S = \{\}$$
$$Q_{pr} = [+][1][2]$$
$$E_{pr} = +12$$

    <p>
    where \(\{\}\) represents an empty stack (set).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Infix to Postfix:</strong>
    </p>

$$E_{in} = 1 + 2$$
$$Q_{in} = [1][+][2]$$
$$Q_{po} = [1]$$
$$S = [+]$$
$$Q_{po} = [1][2]$$
$$S = \{\}$$
$$Q_{po} = [1][2][+]$$
$$E_{po} = 12+$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Precedence</strong>
    <p>

    <p>
    Currently our conversion algorithm does not handle collisions of operators
    with different precedence levels. For example, the following expression in an
    infix notation:
    </p>

$$E_{in} = 1 + 2 \times 3$$

    <p>
    renders correctly in a postfix but not in a prefix form (prove it). The
    following expression in an infix notation:
    </p>

$$E_{in} = 2 \times 3 + 4$$

    <p>
    renders correctly in a prefix but not in a postfix form (prove it). It follows
    then that the original version of the conversion algorithm may work for some
    favorable expressions for some output notations.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since the algorithm must work for arbitrary expressions for both output
    notations, augment it to handle collisions of operators with different
    precedence levels as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">while ( input items remain )
{
	obtain next input item
	if ( item is an operand )
		add operand to output queue
	else
		<strong>next operator = this input item
		previous operator = the one at top of stack
		if ( next operator's precedence < previous operator's precedence )
		{
			remove previous operator from stack
			add previous operator to output queue
		}</strong>
		add next operator to stack

while ( stack not empty )
{
	remove operator from stack
	add operator to output queue
}</p>

    <p>
    Observe that, again, the current modification of the algorithm respects its
    previous version keeping it output notation-neutral.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Commentary</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Starting from this version of the conversion algorithm it becomes clear why
    a stack is used to temporarily store processed operators - because a stack
    is an effective input reverser.
    </p>

    <p>
    Assume that a queue \(Q\) has the following contents:
    </p>

$$Q = [A][B][C]$$

    <p>
    Removing the input items from \(Q\)'s right-most extremity and adding them
    to a stack \(S\), we obtain:
    </p>

$$Q = \{\}$$
$$S = [A][B][C]$$

    <p>
    Since items can enter and leave a stack only through one of its extremities
    (left-most in this case), by removing the items from \(S\) and adding them
    to \(Q\), we obtain:
    </p>

$$Q = [C][B][A]$$

    <p>
    which effectively reverses the order of items in \(Q\). It follows that by
    repeating the above exercise an even number of times we will restore the order
    of items in \(Q\) to its original.
    </p>

    <p>
    Reversing the order of operators is a frequent task while computing the
    value of an arithmetic expression rendered in an infix notation. Recall
    our earlier observation that prefix and postfix are execute-when-encountered
    notations. By using a stack to reverse the physical location of an operator
    within an output queue we, effectively, fix its proper order of execution.
    </p>

    <p>
    Lastly, because we scan the input in the same direction that we will scan the
    output during the computational pass the above algorithm is applicable to
    both types of output notations - prefix and postfix.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Sample Calculation</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Infix to Prefix:</strong>
    </p>

$$E_{in} = 1 + 2 \times 3$$
$$Q_{in} = [1][+][2][\times][3]$$
$$Q_{pr} = [3]$$
$$S = [\times]$$
$$Q_{pr} = [2][3]$$
$$S = [+]$$
$$Q_{pr} = [\times][2][3]$$
$$Q_{pr} = [1][\times][2][3]$$
$$S = \{\}$$
$$Q_{pr} = [+][1][\times][2][3]$$
$$E_{pr} = +1 \times 23$$

    <p>
    Prove to yourself that the second version of the conversion algorithm handles
    collisions of operators of different precedence levels correctly (barring
    expressions rendered in an infix form with order of operators' execution
    modifiers) by experimenting with various inputs and output notations.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Associativity</strong>
    <p>

    <p>
    Currently our conversion algorithm does not handle collisions of operators
    with the same precedence levels. For example, the following expression in an
    infix notation:
    </p>

$$E_{in} = 9 - 4 + 1$$

    <p>
    renders correctly in a prefix but not in a postfix form (prove it).
    </p>

    <p>
    Augment the conversion algorithm to handle collisions of operators with the
    same precedence as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">while ( input items remain )
{
	obtain next input item
	if ( item is an operand )
		add operand to output queue
	else
		next operator = this input item
		<strong>while ( stack not empty )
		{</strong>
			previous operator = the one at top of stack
			if ( next operator's precedence < previous operator's precedence )
			{
				remove previous operator from stack
				add previous operator to output queue
			}
			<strong>else if ( next operator's precedence == previous operator's precedence )
			{
				if ( operators' associativities do not match )
					return error
				else if ( operators are left-associative )
				{
					if ( notation == postfix )
					{
						remove previous operator from stack
						add previous operator to output queue
					}
					else
						break
				}
				else if ( operators are right-associative )
				{
					if ( notation == prefix )
					{
						remove previous operator from stack
						add previous operator to output queue
					}
					else
						break
				}
			}
			else if ( next operator's precedence > previous operator's precedence )
				break
		}</strong>
		add next operator to stack

while ( stack not empty )
{
	remove operator from stack
	add operator to output queue
}</p>

    <p>
    Explain why algorithmic steps that handle operators' associativity are similar
    to the steps that handle operators' precedence.
    </p>

    <p>
    Prove to yourself that the current version of the conversion algorithm
    handles operators' precedence and associativity properly.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>OOEMs</strong>
    <p>

    <p>
    To handle <span id="inlncode">OOEM</span>s we shall add output
    notation-specific opening <span id="inlncode">OOEM</span> to a stack as is
    so that later on it will signal the end of removal of parenthesised operators
    from the stack and addition of them to the output queue.
    </p>

    <p>
    When we come across an output notation-specific closing
    <span id="inlncode">OOEM</span> we shall implement the order of execution
    modification proper by removing the parenthesised operators from the stack
    and adding them to the output queue until the output notation-specific opening
    <span id="inlncode">OOEM</span> is seen which must occur in an expression
    with a properly balanced parenthesis.
    <p>

    <p>
    Since we scan the input left to right to produce an expression in a postfix
    notation, it follows that the opening postfix <span id="inlncode">OOEM</span>
    is a left parenthesis, <span id="inlncode">(</span>, ASCII decimal \(40\),
    while its closing <span id="inlncode">OOEM</span> is a right parenthesis,
    <span id="inlncode">)</span>, ASCII decimal \(41\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Correspondingly, the opening prefix <span id="inlncode">OOEM</span>
    is a right parenthesis, <span id="inlncode">)</span>, ASCII decimal \(41\),
    while its closing <span id="inlncode">OOEM</span> is a left parenthesis,
    <span id="inlncode">(</span>, ASCII decimal \(40\):
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">while ( input items remain )
{
	obtain next input item
	if ( item is an operand )
		add operand to output queue
	<strong>else if ( item is an opening OOEM )
		add opening OOEM to stack

		balanced = false
		while ( stack not empty )
		{
			remove top operator
			if ( top operator is an opening OOEM )
				balanced = true
				break
			else
				add operator to output queue
		}
		if ( balanced == false )
			return error</strong>
	else
		next operator = this input item
		while ( stack not empty )
		{
			previous operator = the one at top of stack
			if ( next operator's precedence < previous operator's precedence )
			{
				remove previous operator from stack
				add previous operator to output queue
			}
			else if ( next operator's precedence == previous operator's precedence )
			{
				if ( operators' associativities do not match )
					return error
				else if ( operators are left-associative )
				{
					if ( notation == postfix )
					{
						remove previous operator from stack
						add previous operator to output queue
					}
					else
						break
				}
				else if ( operators are right-associative )
				{
					if ( notation == prefix )
					{
						remove previous operator from stack
						add previous operator to output queue
					}
					else
						break
				}
			}
			else if ( next operator's precedence > previous operator's precedence )
				break
		}
		add next operator to stack

while ( stack not empty )
{
	remove operator from stack
	<strong>if ( operator is an opening OOEM )
		return error</strong>
	add operator to output queue
}</p>

    <p>
    The purpose of the new steps at the end of the conversion algorithm is to
    detect the syntactical errors of unbalanced parenthesis.
    </p>

    <p>
    Use the final version of the conversion algorithm to transform various
    expressions rendered in an infix notation to its equivalents in prefix and
    postfix forms.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Computation</strong>
    <p>

    <p>
    of the numerical value of an expression rendered in a requested output
    notation captured in the output queue (or an abstract syntax tree) is
    the purpose of the second pass of the Shunting Yard algorithm.
    <p>

    <p>
    Recall that in the first, conversion, pass of the Shunting Yard algorithm a
    stack was used to temporarily store only operators on it. In the second,
    computation, pass of the algorithm a stack is used to accumulate only
    operands on it. As such, the order in which left and right hand side operands
    of binary operators are obtained from the stack is output notation-specific.
    <p>

    <p>
    In a prefix notation the first removal produces a left hand side operand
    while the second removal produces a right hand side operand (explain why).
    <p>

    <p>
    In a postfix notation the first removal produces a right hand side operand
    while the second removal produces a left hand side operand (explain why):
    <p>

    <p id="srccode">while ( items in output queue remain )
	remove next item
	if ( item is an operand )
	{
		add operand to stack
	}
	else
	{
		item = operator
		if ( notation == postfix )
		{
			right operand = remove top item from stack
			left operand = remove top item from stack
		}
		else
		{
			left operand = remove top item from stack
			right operand = remove top item from stack
		}
		result = execute operator
		add result back to stack
	}

	return: the only item left at top of stack</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Sample Calculation</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Infix to Prefix:</strong>
    </p>

$$E_{in} = 1 + 2 \times 3$$
$$Q_{pr} = [+][1][\times][2][3]$$
$$S = [3]$$
$$Q_{pr} = [+][1][\times][2]$$
$$S = [2][3]$$
$$Q_{pr} = [+][1][\times]$$
$$op = \times$$
$$Q_{pr} = [+][1]$$
$$S = \{\}$$
$$r = 2 \times 3 = 6$$
$$S = [6]$$
$$S = [1][6]$$
$$Q_{pr} = [+]$$
$$op = +$$
$$Q_{pr} = \{\}$$
$$r = 1 + 6 = 7$$
$$S = [7]$$
$$r = 7$$
$$S = \{\}$$

    To help you visualize the inner mechanics of the Shunting Yard algorithm as
    it is applied to arithmetic expressions I have put together an interactive
    Java GUI program that accepts an arbitrary arithmetic expression as input
    and plays out the entire calculation in slow motion.
