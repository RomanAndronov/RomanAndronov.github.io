    <h1>
    Epilog
    </h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Reality Check</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Being a part of a tutorial, the well-polished and smooth steps and source code
    presented here are no doubt idealistic to some degree but are representative
    nonetheless.
    </p>

    <p>
    An activity absent from this discussion that, however, can not be avoided in
    practice - debugging - aids a deeper understanding of a problem at the current
    iteration and facilitates the success during the next one.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Exercises</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    To convince yourself that you have a firm grasp of the Shunting Yard algorithm
    add an exponentiation operator to <span id="inlncode">AEC</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Potential</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    With an arbitrary naming convention aimed at reducing the token-recognition
    complexity <span id="inlncode">AEC</span> can be augmented to accept:
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>symbolic constants</li>
     <li>variables</li>
     <li>functions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    as input.
    </p>

    <p>
    The names of symbolic constants, for example, may be stipulated to be
    delineated with an underscore, ASCII decimal \(95\), character:
    </p>

$$\_Pi\_ = 3.1415$$
$$\_E\_ = 2.718$$
$$\_EulersGamma\_ = 0.577215$$

    <p>
    The names of variables may be stipulated to be comprised of lower case
    letters only:
    </p>

$$limit$$
$$area$$
$$volume$$

    <p>
    The names of functions may be stipulated to begin with an upper case letter:
    </p>

$$Cos$$
$$Sin$$
$$Log$$

    <p>
    Constants and variables should be treated as operands while functions should
    be treated as operators of highest precedence.
    </p>

    <p>
    Then, a second power of cosine of seven radians renders in an infix notation
    as follows:
    </p>

$$E_{in} = Cos(7)\wedge 2$$

    <p>
    which renders in prefix and postfix notations as follows:
    </p>

$$E_{pr} = [\wedge] [Cos] [7] [2]$$
$$E_{po} = [7] [Cos] [2] [\wedge]$$

    <p>
    On the other hand:
    </p>

$$E_{in} = Cos(7\wedge 2)$$
$$E_{pr} = [Cos] [\wedge] [7] [2]$$
$$E_{po} = [7] [2] [\wedge] [Cos]$$

    <p>
    And:
    </p>

$$E_{in} = Cos(7) \times 2$$
$$E_{pr} = [\times] [Cos] [7] [2]$$
$$E_{po} = [7] [Cos] [2] [\times]$$

    <p>
    Further:
    </p>

$$E_{in} = Cos(7) \times_1 Tan(9) \times_2 Sin(11)$$
$$E_{pr} = [\times_2] [\times_1] [Cos] [7] [Tan] [9] [Sin] [11]$$
$$E_{po} = [7] [Cos] [9] [Tan] [\times_1] [11] [Sin] [\times_2]$$

    <p>
    And:
    </p>

$$E_{in} = Cos(Tan(Sin(Cot(13))))$$
$$E_{pr} = [Cos] [Tan] [Sin] [Cot] [13]$$
$$E_{po} = [13] [Cot] [Sin] [Tan] [Cos]$$

    <p>
    and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    To demonstratie the abstract power of the Shunting Yard algorithm we will
    adjust it to operate on Boolean expressions consisting of human-readable
    strings as operands and logical operators <span id="inlncode">NOT, AND,
    OR</span> next.
    </p>
