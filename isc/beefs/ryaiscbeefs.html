    <h1>
    BEEFS
    </h1>

    <p>
    To demonstrate the abstract power of the Shunting Yard algorithm let us
    adapt it to operate on Boolean expressions composed of human-readable
    strings and Boolean operators as Boolean Expressions Evaluator For Strings
    or <span id="inlncode">BEEFS</span> for short.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Whole</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    in <span id="inlncode">BEEFS</span> is a combination of a <dfn>rule</dfn>
    and a <dfn>test phrase</dfn> or just <dfn>phrase</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    A <dfn>word</dfn>, initially, is an arbitrarily sized contiguous block of an
    arbitrary mix of upper and/or lower case letters of (in our case) an English
    alphabet delineated by Boolean operators, <span id="inlncode">OOEM</span>s,
    white space and the extremities of an input container when a word is the very
    last or the very first item in it:
    </p>

$$quick$$
$$brown$$

    <p>
    A standard initial set of Boolean operators is <span id="inlncode">NOT, AND,
    OR</span> which we will designate with the following ASCII characters:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">NOT == !, ASCII decimal 33
AND == &, ASCII decimal 38
OR == |, ASCII decimal 124</p>

    <p>
    <span id="inlncode">NOT</span> is a prefix unary right-associative operator.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span id="inlncode">AND</span> is a binary left-associative operator.
    </p>

    <p>
    <span id="inlncode">OR</span> is a binary left-associative operator.
    </p>

    <p>
    Sorting the above operators in a descending order of precedence, from highest
    to lowest, we obtain:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">NOT
AND
OR</p>

    <p>
    A rule is an arbitrary properly syntaxed collection of Boolean operators,
    <span id="inlncode">OOEM</span>s from <span id="inlncode">AEC</span> and
    words which play the role of arguments of Boolean operators:
    </p>

$$quick \quad \& \quad brown$$

    <p>
    A phrase is an arbitrary collection of words:
    </p>

$$a \quad quick \quad brown \quad fox \quad jumps \quad over \quad lazy \quad dog$$

    <p>
    Both, a rule and a phrase, have an arbitrary and finite length.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Application</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    It is said that a <dfn>"rule is applied to a phrase"</dfn> or, conversely, a
    <dfn>"phrase is tested against a rule"</dfn> when an entire phrase is
    dragged or trawled through the entire rule or vice versa.
    </p>

    <p>
    The result of such application or testing is Boolean - it is taken to be
    <span id="inlncode">true</span> if a phrase passes or satisfies a rule and
    it is taken to be <span id="inlncode">false</span> otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
    We observe here that there is a difference between
    <span id="inlncode">AEC</span>'s and <span id="inlncode">BEEFS</span>'
    operators' execution - in the former it is <dfn>local</dfn> while in the
    latter it is <dfn>global</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, in the following arithmetic expression rendered in an infix
    notation:
    </p>

$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 \times 5$$

    <p>
    the arithmetic multiplication operator is only concerned with its immediately
    local operands, \(4\) and \(5\), and ignores completely the contents of the
    remaining arithmetic expression.
    </p>

    <p>
    In <span id="inlncode">BEEFS</span>, however, this is <dfn>not</dfn> the case
    as every operator tests its operand(s) against the entire phrase.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, let a rule \(R\), rendered in an infix notation and consisting
    of a single operator for simplicity, be:
    </p>

$$R = \; ! \; brown$$

    <p>
    and let a phrase \(F\) be:
    </p>

$$F = a \quad quick \quad brown \quad fox \quad jumps$$

    <p>
    In this case the result of application of \(R\) to \(F\) is
    <span id="inlncode">false</span>:
    </p>

$$R(F)=false$$

    <p>
    because \(F\) does contain the word <span id="inlncode">brown</span>
    which it should not for a result to be <span id="inlncode">true</span>. In
    other words, for an arbitrary phrase to pass \(R\) the phrase must not contain
    the word <span id="inlncode">brown</span>:
    </p>

$$F = a \quad quick \quad lazy \quad fox \quad jumps$$
$$R(F) = true$$

    <p>
    Further, let:
    </p>

$$R = quick \quad \& \quad brown$$
$$F_1 = a \quad quick \quad brown \quad fox \quad jumps$$
$$F_2 = a \quad quick \quad lazy \quad fox \quad jumps$$

    <p>
    in which case:
    </p>

$$R(F_1) = true$$
$$R(F_2) = false$$

    <p>
    since \(F_1\) contains both required words, <span id="inlncode">quick</span>
    and <span id="inlncode">brown</span>, while \(F_2\) does not.
    </p>

    <p>
    Lastly:
    </p>

$$R = quick \quad | \quad brown$$
$$F_1 = a \quad quick \quad brown \quad fox \quad jumps$$
$$F_2 = a \quad quick \quad lazy \quad fox \quad jumps$$
$$F_3 = a \quad lasy \quad brown \quad fox \quad jumps$$
$$F_4 = a \quad lazy \quad fox \quad jumps$$

    <p>
    in which case:
    </p>

$$R(F_1) = R(F_2) = R(F_3) = true$$
$$R(F_4) = false$$

    <p>
    Explain why.
    </p>

    <p>
    When multiple Boolean operators are strung together in a rule then the result
    of execution of each such operator is recorded in an item of a special,
    <span id="inlncode">boolean</span>, type - not a human-readable string (word)
    - and pushed back onto the stack with a value of <span id="inlncode">true</span>
    or <span id="inlncode">false</span> obtained as per the rules described above.
    </p>

    <p>
    It follows then that <span id="inlncode">BEEFS</span> Boolean operators'
    execution must cope with either type of operands -
    <span id="inlncode">word</span> and <span id="inlncode">boolean</span>.
    Further, in a properly syntaxed rule the last and the only item left on the
    stack at the end of the computation pass of the Shunting Yard algorithm will
    be of type <span id="inlncode">boolean</span> which dictates the type of the
    overall result of testing of a phrase against a rule.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>XOR</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    If we treat the above three Boolean operators as <dfn>fundamental</dfn> or
    <dfn>basic</dfn> then, on the one hand, it is quite challenging to define them
    unambiguously and, on the other hand, it is possible to use them as building
    blocks to construct composite or more complex Boolean operators. For example,
    an exclusive <span id="inlncode">OR</span> or <span id="inlncode">XOR</span>,
    <span id="inlncode">^</span>, ASCII decimal \(94\), can always be modeled via
    the stock Boolean operators in a multitude of ways. For example:
    </p>

$$p \quad XOR \quad q =
p \quad \wedge \quad q =(p \quad \& \quad !q) \quad | \quad (!p \quad \& \quad q)$$

    <p>
    In practice, however, it is not uncommon for rules to span five or more
    A4-sized pages. As such, any effort to shorten a rule is welcome and we shall
    implement <span id="inlncode">XOR</span> natively as a binary left-associative
    operator with a precedence level between <span id="inlncode">AND</span> and
    <span id="inlncode">OR</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Exists</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Sometimes it may desirable to able to test a phrase for an existence of a
    single word within <span id="inlncode">BEEF</span>'s boundaries. In that case
    a rule will consist of a single word:
    </p>

$$quick$$

    <p>
    for example, and, since we will manufacture the <dfn>Exists</dfn> operator
    internally, there is no need for a dedicated symbol to designate it - we
    will treat is a prefix unary right-associative operator disregarding its
    precedence.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Implementation</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    of the Shunting Yard algorithm in <span id="inlncode">BEEFS</span> deviates
    from its <span id="inlncode">AEC</span> counterpart only in the operators'
    execution portion.
    </p>

    <p>
    While <span id="inlncode">AEC</span>'s arithmetic operators require their
    operands only, <span id="inlncode">BEEFS</span>' Boolean operators require
    their operands <dfn>and</dfn> a test phrase in its entirety. It follows then
    that a test phrase or its tokenized or pre-parsed equivalent must percolate
    through the functions' call stack all the way to the code that carries out
    operators' execution.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Finding</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    a word - an operand of a Boolean operator - within a test phrase is an
    operation that yields a Boolean result. We shall initially implement it
    as an exact match:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">boolean
findWord( String phrase, boolean cs )</p>

    <p>
    where the second argument is the case sensitivity designator.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>NOT</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    operator, then, is implemented in terms of
    <span id="inlncode">findWord()</span> as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">boolean
executeNot( String phrase, boolean cs, BeItem right )
{
	boolean			rv = false;

	rv = !right.findWord( phrase, cs );

	return rv;
}</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>AND:</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">boolean
executeAnd( String phrase, boolean cs, BeItem left, BeItem right )
{
	boolean			rv = false;

	rv = left.findWord( phrase, cs );
	if ( rv == false )
	{
		return false;
	}

	rv = right.findWord( phrase, cs );

	return rv;
}</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>XOR:</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">boolean
executeXor( String phrase, boolean cs, BeItem left, BeItem right )
{
	boolean			lhs = false;
	boolean			rhs = false;
	boolean			rv = false;

	lhs = left.findWord( phrase, cs );
	rhs = right.findWord( phrase, cs );

	rv = lhs ^ rhs;

	return rv;
}</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>OR:</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">boolean
executeOr( String phrase, boolean cs, BeItem left, BeItem right )
{
	boolean			rv = false;

	rv = left.findWord( phrase, cs );
	if ( rv == true )
	{
		return true;
	}

	rv = right.findWord( phrase, cs );

	return rv;
}</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Exists:</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">boolean
executeExists( String phrase, boolean cs, BeItem right )
{
	boolean			rv = false;

	rv = right.findWord( phrase, cs );

	return rv;
}</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Potential</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    It is possible to treat rules' words as regular expressions in which case
    a rule:
    </p>

$$dog \quad | \quad cat$$

    <p>
    will match the words <span id="inlncode">dog</span> and
    <span id="inlncode">cat</span> exactly, while the rule:
    </p>

$$d[aeiouy]\{1\}g \quad | \quad c[aeiouy]\{1\}t$$

    <p>
    will match <span id="inlncode">dog, cat, dig, dug, cot, cut,</span> etc.
    producing more positive results.
    </p>
