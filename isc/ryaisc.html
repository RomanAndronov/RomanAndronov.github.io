    <h1>
    Incremental Software Construction
    </h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Tutorial</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    consists of two parts and explores the fundamentals of the incremental
    software construction process using the Shunting Yard algorithm as a
    reference.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the first part of the tutorial we will use the Shunting Yard algorithm
    to create a fully functional Arithmetic Expressions Calculator,
    <span id="inlncode">AEC</span>, that accepts numbers is its input.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the second part of the tutorial we will adapt the Shunting Yard algorithm
    to accept human-readable strings as its input by developing a fully functional
    Boolean Expressions Evaluator For Strings, <span id="inlncode">BEEFS</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Both Shunting Yard algorithm implementations, in
    <span id="inlncode">AEC</span> and in <span id="inlncode">BEEFS</span>, are
    non-recursive and both use a linear container as their processing medium.
    </p>

    <p>
    Work through <span id="inlncode">AEC</span> first.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Principles</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Some of the fundamental principles of incremental software construction
    process are:
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>Wholesome vision</li>
     <li>Deductive workflow</li>
     <li>Simultaneous comparison</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Wholesome Vision</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    is an ability to capture in one's mind the whole problem in its entirety, at
    once. Ideally the understanding of the essence of a problem at hand should
    be acquired before the keyboard is touched.
    </p>

    <p>
    Wholesome vision is applicable recursively to a collection of projects, a
    single project, which is a collection of applications and libraries, a single
    application or a single library, either of which is a collection of native
    and custom data types, functions and other language-specific constructs, a
    single custom data type, a single function, a single statement, a single
    expression and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Deductive Workflow</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    mimics the deductive reasoning process discovered by the ancient Greeks
    circa \(500-300\) BC, vividly demonstrated by Euclid in his
    <dfn>"Elements"</dfn>, and proceeds as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>from outside in</li>
     <li>from whole to part</li>
     <li>from large to small</li>
     <li>from generic to specific</li>
     <li>from abstract to concrete</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Capturing the above workflow algorithmically:
    </p>

    <p id="srccode">parts = container of all parts (including whole)
sort parts by size in descending order - from largest (whole) to smallest
for ( i = 0; i < parts count; i++ )
{
	implement parts[ i ];
}</p>

    <p>
    we obtain some of its consequences:
    </p>

    <p>
    - the scope of work is fixed ahead of time
    </p>

    <p>
    - the scope and cost of mistakes should diminish with time
    </p>

    <p>
    - the likelihood that the final result and the original idea coincide should
    increase with time
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Simultaneous Comparison</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    is the process of juxtaposing of a part against the whole with the purpose
    of verifying that the former is chosen correctly and occupies the place
    that it should within the latter. Wholesome vision may come at the expense
    of temporary loss of narrow focus on minor details. The process of simultaneous
    comparison ensures that these details fall into place naturally.
