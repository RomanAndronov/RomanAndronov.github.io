    <h1>Ruler and Compass Constructions 01</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Brocard Points</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    For some time at the very end of the nineteenth and the very beginning of the
    twentieth centuries Hungary held Mathematical Contests aimed at mathematically
    inclined youth. The problems from these competitions were translated into
    English and published in a series of small books, one of which,
    <dfn>"Hungarian Problem Book I based on the Eotvos Competitions,
    1894-1905"</dfn>, I own.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here is a problem number two from the 1895 competition:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg" class="center">
    <dfn>construct a point \(N\) inside an arbitrary right triangle \(ABC\) so
    that all three angles \(NBC\), \(NCA\) and \(NAB\) are equal</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Process</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Why right triangle? Why does it have to be right triangle? How this fact
    can be used?
    </p>

    <p>
    What approach can be used to solve this problem? Division? Divide the problem
    into parts so simple that each one can be solved separately, combine the
    solutions of the parts into a solution of the whole.
    </p>

    <p>
    What are the parts? The angles:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs01/pserac0101.png" alt="RaC0101" class="center">

    <p>
    If the angle \(\angle ABC\) is right then the angle \(\angle NBA\) is:
    </p>

$$90 - \alpha$$

    <p>
    Since the sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always two right
    angles, for \(\triangle ANB\) we have:
    </p>

$$\angle NAB + \angle ANB + \angle NBA = 180$$
$$\alpha + x + 90 - \alpha = 180$$
$$x + 90 = 180$$
$$x = 90$$

    <p>
    <br>A ninety degree angle - can a circle be of use*? In the final construction,
    whatever the angles \(\alpha\) will happen to be, the angle \(ANB\) will
    have to be right:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs01/pserac0102.png" alt="RaC0102" class="center">

    <p>
    If a circle is constructed with \(AB\) as its diameter then for any point
    \(N\) on its circumference the angle \(ANB\) will be right.
    </p>

    <p>
    Constructing such a circle is trivial - bisect \(AB\) to locate \(O\) which
    will be the circle's center and will also determine the circle's radius,
    \(OB = OA\).
    </p>

    <p>
    The points on the circumference of that circle outside \(\triangle ABC\) are
    not interesting since the problem states that the point \(N\) must be located
    inside the triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
    Consider the circular arc inside the triangle. Any point on that arc will
    make the angle \(\angle ANB\) right ensuring that the angles \(NAB\) and
    \(NBC\) are equal**. That solves the problem only partially. The fact that:
    </p>

$$\angle NAB = \angle NBC$$

    <p>
    does not guarantee that:
    </p>

$$\angle NCA = \angle NAB = \angle NBC$$
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>Now what?
    </p>

    <img src="imgs01/pserac0103.png" alt="RaC0103" class="center">

    <p>
    Examine the remaining triangles \(CNB\) and \(CNA\) in the same way we
    examined the triangle \(ANB\). Let \(\angle CNB = y\) and \(\angle CNA = z\).
    Then:
    </p>

$$x + y + z = 360$$
$$x = 90$$
$$y + z = 270$$
$$\alpha + y + \angle NCB = 180$$
$$\alpha + z + \angle NAC = 180$$

    <p>
    Does not seem to go anywhere. Dead end.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>Idea: construct arbitrary angles \(PCA\) that are equal to the angles
    \(PBC\) completely disregarding \(N\) and the angles associated with it.
    </p>

    <p>
    Assume that \(P\) is somewhere inside the triangle and is different from \(N\):
    </p>
   
    <img src="imgs01/pserac0104.png" alt="RaC0104" class="center">

    <p>
    If we can somehow make the angle \(PBC\) be equal to the angle \(NBC\) and make
    \(P\) coincide with \(N\) then by the virtue of the previous circle-based
    construction the angle \(NAB\) will have no choice but to be equal to the angle
    \(NBC\) which is equal to the angle \(PBC\) which is equal to the angle \(PCA\)
    which solves the problem completely.
    </p>

    <p>
    How can we do that?
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>How many angles such that \(\angle PCA = \angle PBC\) can be constructed?
    An infinite amount. How about just a few?
    </p>

    <img src="imgs01/pserac0105.png" alt="RaC0105" class="center">

    <p>
    The vertexes of the constructed triangles - points \(P\) - seem to be located
    on an arc of some sort. Not very clear where this is going though.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>Simplify. Instead of applying this \(\angle PCA = \angle PBC\)
    construction to a given acute angle \(\angle ACB\) apply it to a simpler -
    right angle. Make the angle \(ACB\) right temporarily, for the experimental
    purposes. Throw out the rest of the irrelevant details and construct some
    number of points \(P\) for each of which \(\angle PCA = \angle PBC\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs01/pserac0106.png" alt="RaC0106" class="center">

    <p>
    All the points \(P\) seem to belong to a circumference of a circle. Hypothesis
    - the center of that circle must be the middle of \(CB\). Is it? Looks
    plausible. Then, \(AC\), being perpendicular to the circle's diameter \(CB\),
    is tangent to that circle.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>If \(AC\) is pushed down as a lever welded permanently to the circle
    \(CO_1B\) at \(C\) then the angle \(ACB\), becoming smaller and smaller,
    will eventually be equal to the corresponding angle of the given right
    triangle:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs01/pserac0107.png" alt="RaC0107" class="center">

    <p>
    And, because the connection of \(AC\) to the circle \(CO_1B\) at \(C\) is
    permanent, the circle's diameter will unbuckle itself from \(CB\) but it
    will remain perpendicular to \(AC\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Consequently, the circle's center \(O_1\) will start gliding along the
    perpendicular bisector of \(CB\). The radius of the circle will grow. What
    used to be a full half circle will now become a smaller and smaller arc
    trapped inside the triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
    Hence, the center of that circle must be at the intersection of the
    perpendicular bisector of \(CB\) and a perpendicular to \(AC\) through
    the point \(C\)***. The circles \(AOB\) and \(CO_1B\) will intersect at two
    points. One of them will be inside of the triangle and that is the point
    we are looking for.
    </p>

    <p>
    Stop the timer. Problem solved:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs01/pserac0108.png" alt="RaC0108" class="center">

    <p>
    The solution is****:
    </p>

    <p>
    - bisect \(AB\) to locate the point \(O\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - circle with center at \(O\) and radius \(OA = OB\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - bisect \(CB\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - perpendicular to \(AC\) through \(C\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(CB\)'s bisector and the above perpendicular intersect at \(O_1\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - circle with the center at \(O_1\) and radius \(O_1C = O_1B\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - the intersection of the two circles inside the triangle is the point
    sought after, \(N\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Conclusions</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    - it took me about an hour, hour and a half of non-continuous effort to work
    out the solution
    </p>

    <p>
    - as much as we want the search for a solution to be purely logical and
    smooth it rarely is. Some ideas do form purely logical chains but are very
    often interspersed with fuzzy hunches, gut feelings and vague thoughts with
    no explanation of where did they come from. Some ideas lead nowhere while
    others actually lead to a solution
    </p>

    <p>
    - while pattern recognition is almost instantaneous the search for the
    pattern, not surprisingly, is anything but. If we do not know exactly what to
    look for then how can such a search be algorithmisized?
    </p>

    <p>
    - hind sight is always perfect. After we solve a problem we quite often
    realize how inefficient our search for that solution was
    </p>

    <p>
    After I have found the proofs for my hunches I realized that my search for
    the second circle was way too complicated - I practically rediscovered
    <strong>B3P32</strong> from scratch. Why did I not see that proposition with
    the second circle when I have just used it for the first?
    </p>

    <p>
    - the comparison of my solution to the one presented at the end of the book
    showed that while my construction was indeed correct my reasoning was totally
    different. The book also gave another, even simpler, construction that does not
    need the second circle - only the first one
    </p>

    <p>
    - when we publish our solutions and proofs they look polished and glossy. What
    remains behind the scenes is less glamorous but just as, if not more,
    interesting
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Proofs, Explanations</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    that were omitted during the real time search for a solution.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>*</strong> The association between a right angle and a circle comes
    from Euclid's <strong>B3P31</strong> also known as <dfn>Thales'
    Theorem</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>**</strong> In this construction the angles \(NAB\) and \(NBC\)
    are equal because of <strong>B3P32</strong>, a tangent to a circle and the
    angles in the alternate segments.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>***</strong> This statement is true because of
    <strong>B3P32</strong> and <strong>B3P21</strong>. Construct the line segment
    \(ND\) where \(D\) is the second point of intersection of \(CO_1\) and the
    circle \(CO_1B\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs01/pserac0109.png" alt="RaC0109" class="center">

    <p>
    Apply <strong>B3P32</strong> to the tangent \(AC\), circle \(CO_1B\) and
    the angle \(NDC\):
    </p>

$$\angle NCA = \angle NDC$$

    <p>
    But \(\angle NDC\) subtends the arc \(NC\) which is also subtended by
    \(\angle NBC\). From <strong>B3P21</strong> it follows that:
    </p>

$$\angle NDC = \angle NBC$$

    <p>
    from where it follows that:
    </p>

$$\angle NCA = \angle NBC$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>****</strong> Since there are no additional constraints in this
    problem, it is also possible to carry out the similar steps with the other
    vertex and side of the right triangle by constructing the first circle on
    \(CB\) as its diameter and the second circle on the perpendicular to \(AC\)
    through \(A\) in which case three different angles will be equal to one
    another:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs01/pserac0110.png" alt="RaC0110" class="center">

    <p>
    <br><strong>Derivatives</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    1) From the previous construction we conclude that the two circles built on
    the sides of the right triangle as their diameters intersect at two points.
    The first intersection point is the vertex of the right angle, \(B\). The
    other intersection point, \(D\), is located on the hypotenuse of the right
    triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
    If the magnitudes of lengths of two sides of a right triangle are known then
    in what ratio does \(D\) cut \(AC\)?
    </p>

    <img src="imgs01/pserac0111.png" alt="RaC0111" class="center">

    <p>
    Since \(D\) belongs to the circumferences of both circles then either circle
    can be used to prove that based on <strong>B3P31</strong>:
    </p>

$$\angle ADB = \angle BDC = 90^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    It follows then that \(\triangle ABC, \triangle ADB\) and \(\triangle BDC\)
    are similar and from <strong>B6P4</strong> it follows that their sides about
    equal angles are in the same proportion. From the similarity of
    \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ADB\) it follows that:
    </p>

$$\frac {AD}{AB} = \frac {AB}{AC}$$
$$AD = \frac {AB^2}{AC}$$

    <p>
    From the similarity of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle BDC\) it follows
    that:
    </p>

$$\frac {DC}{CB} = \frac {CB}{AC}$$
$$DC = \frac {CB^2}{AC}$$

    <p>
    from where it follows that:
    </p>

$$\frac {AD}{DC} = \frac {AB^2}{AC} \times \frac {AC}{CB^2} =$$
$$\frac {AB^2}{CB^2} =$$
$$\Big(\frac {AB}{CB}\Big)^2 =$$
$$tan^2( \angle ACB)$$

    <p>
    From the straight edge and compass construction perspective we obtain a way
    to to cut a line segment of length:
    </p>

$$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

    <p>
    in the ratio:
    </p>

$$\Big(\frac {a}{b}\Big)^2$$

    <p>
    if \(a\) and \(b\) are given.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>2) Once a solution for a right triangle is found we can generalize the
    problem for an arbitrary triangle. Below we present a solution for an acute
    triangle. You are encouraged to perform the corresponding construction for
    an obtuse triangle yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
    In case of a right triangle the side \(AB\) coincided with the
    perpendicular to \(CB\) through \(B\) and, conversely, the side \(CB\)
    coincided with the perpendicular to \(AB\) through \(B\). That is why we
    were able to construct the first pair of circles simply by bisecting \(AB\)
    and \(CB\). Since in an acute or an obtuse triangle no angle is right, the
    perpendiculars to the corresponding sides of the triangle must be constructed
    explicitly:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs01/pserac0112.png" alt="RaC0112" class="center">

    <p>
    For example, construct a perpendicular \(p_1\) to \(AC\) through \(C\). Moving
    clockwise, bisect \(CB\) with \(b_1\). The intersection of \(p_1\) and
    \(b_1\) locates the center \(O_1\) of the circle \(q_1\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Moving clockwise, construct a perpendicular \(p_2\) to \(CB\) through \(B\).
    Moving clockwise, bisect \(AB\) with \(b_2\). The intersection of \(p_2\)
    and \(b_2\) locates the center \(O_2\) of the circle \(q_2\). One of the
    intersection points of \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) is \(N_1\) - the point sought
    after.
    </p>

    <p>
    Still moving clockwise, construct a perpendicular \(p_3\) to \(AC\) through
    \(A\). The intersection of \(p_3\) and \(b_2\) locates the center \(O_3\)
    of the circle \(q_3\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Changing direction and moving counterclockwise, construct a perpendicular
    \(p_4\) to \(AB\) through \(B\). The intersection of \(p_4\) and \(b_1\)
    locates the center \(O_4\) of the circle \(q_4\). One of the intersection
    points of \(q_3\) and \(q_4\) is \(N_2\) - the point sought after.
    </p>

    <p>
    The points \(N_1\) and \(N_2\) are known as <dfn>Brocard Points</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>3) Lastly, in connection with all the circles that we have constructed
    so far:
    </p>

    <p class="center" id="dbg">
    <dfn>what is the locus of points from which a given line segment is always
    seen from a given angle?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    From <strong>B3P21</strong>, in a circle the angles in the same segment equal
    one another, it follows that the above locus is two partial circumferences of
    equal radii with centers on the perpendicular bisector of the given line
    segment which they share as a common chord - a figure eight with a large
    waist-line.
    </p>

    <p>
    To reconstruct these circumferences Reverse Order approach can be used.
    Assume that the problem has been solved. We first observe that
    <strong>B1P29</strong>, a straight line falling on two straight parallel lines
    makes the alternate angles equal to one another, is applicable to \(AB\)'s
    bisector, \(b\), a perpendicular to \(AB\) through \(B\), \(p\), and a leg
    of a copy of the given angle originating from \(B\), \(l\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs01/pserac0113.png" alt="RaC0113" class="center">

    <p>
    By construction:
    </p>

$$O_1A = O_1B$$

    <p>
    since they are the radii of the same circle from where it follows that
    \(\triangle AO_1B\) is isosceles. From <strong>B1P5</strong>, in an isosceles
    triangle internal angles at the base are equal, it follows that:
    </p>

$$\angle BAO_1 = \angle ABO_1$$

    <p>
    By construction \(O_1C\) is perpendicular to \(AB\) and hence by definition:
    </p>

$$\angle ACO_1 = \angle BCO_1$$

    <p>
    Since the two corresponding angles in \(\triangle ACO_1\) and \(\triangle
    BCO_1\) are equal and <strong>B1P32</strong> states that the sum of internal
    angles in any triangle is two right angles it follows that the remaining
    angles of \(\triangle ACO_1\) and \(\triangle BCO_1\) are equal:
    </p>

$$\angle BO_1C = \angle AO_1C = \alpha$$

    <p>
    from where it follows that:
    </p>

$$AO_1B = 2\alpha$$

    <p>
    Being central, the angle \(AO_1B\), according to <strong>B3P20</strong>, is
    exactly twice the angle at the circumference, \(\alpha\), since both of these
    angles subtend the same arc.
    </p>

    <p>
    The above line or reasoning completes the proof that the following \(13-\)step
    construction solves the problem:
    </p>

    <p>
    - bisect \(AB\) with \(b\) to locate \(C\), three steps
    </p>

    <p>
    - perpendicular \(p\) to \(AB\) through \(B\), three steps
    </p>

    <p>
    - copy of the given angle \(\alpha\) on \(p\) with a vertex at \(B\) with
    the remaining leg \(l\), four steps
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(b\) and \(l\) intersect at \(O_1\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - circle with a center at \(O_1\) and a radius \(O_1A = O_1B\), one step
    </p>

    <p>
    - circle with a center at \(C\) and a radius \(CO_1\) intersects \(b\) at
    \(O_2\), one step
    </p>

    <p>
    - circle with a center at \(O_2\) and a radius \(O_2A = O_2B\), one step
    </p>

    <p>
