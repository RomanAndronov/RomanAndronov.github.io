    <h1>Problem Solving Experiments</h1>

    <p>
    The content in this section is not a traditional set of well-polished and
    elegant solutions to given problems but rather my attempt to record, as
    truthfully as possible, the process of an actual search for a solution with
    all of its false starts, dead ends, stutters and failures.
    </p>

    <p>
    On a technical note we remark that in this section and elsewhere we shall
    refer to the theorems from Euclid's <dfn>"Elements"</dfn> in the form of
    <strong>BnPm</strong> where <strong>n</strong> designates the book and
    <strong>m</strong> designates the proposition number. For example,
    <strong>B3P32</strong> stands for Book 3 Proposition 32 and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    We define a geometric construction step as an act of drawing a new, previously
    not existing, line - either a straight line or a circle. Extending a given
    line segment, ray or a circular arc in either direction does not count as a
    step. Picking an arbitrary point or naming an intersection of two or more
    objects also does not count as a step.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the never ending optimization quest popular in mathematics and computer
    science we seek a solution to a given problem that takes the least amount of
    steps.
