    <h1>B Square</h1>

    <p>
    This problem was given by Prof. Fowler of Ohio State University as part of
    <strong>Calculus 1</strong> course available on <dfn>coursera.org</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg" class="center">
    <dfn>given a square with a side length of \(\sqrt{n}, n = 2, 3, 4, \dots \)
    find a method of cutting the square into some number of pieces which, when
    assembled, form the corresponding \(1 \times n\) rectangle</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Process</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    A rectangle and a corresponding square instantly bring Euclid's
    <strong>B2P14</strong>, to construct a square equal to a given rectilinear
    figure, to mind. In that proposition Euclid transforms an arbitrary
    rectilinear figure into a rectangle with the same square area and then he
    transforms the latter rectangle into a corresponding square.
    </p>

    <p>
    In our case, since we are given a square, it pays to construct the
    corresponding rectangle assuming that a basic unit of measurement equal to
    unity in length is given. Taking Euclid's construction quite literally we
    obtain:
    </p>

    <p>
    Since:
    </p>

$$PT = 1$$

    <p>
    is given, \(Circle( P, PT)\) will intersect the line segment \(PS\) at \(V\)
    which, according to <strong>B2P14</strong>, together with \(Q\) must belong
    to the circumference of a circle that delineates the long side of the
    rectangle sought-after.
    </p>

    <p>
    To locate the center of that circle, \(O\), we observe that the points \(Q\)
    and \(V\) are equidistant from \(O\) by definition. The locus of all the
    points equidistant from two given points is the perpendicular bisector of the
    corresponding line segment. Consequently, the bisector \(b\) of the line
    segment \(QV\) will intersect the straight line \(l\) passing through \(P\)
    and \(S\) at \(O\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Constructing \(Circle(O, OV = OQ)\) locates the point \(A\) on \(l\). A
    perpendicular to \(l\) through \(A\) locates \(B\) via a perpendicular to the
    side \(PQ\) through \(T\). The rectangle \(ABTP\) is the one sought-after.
    </p>

    <p>
    By construction \(\triangle OPQ\) is right:
    </p>

$$OQ^2 = n + x^2$$

    <p>
    and:
    </p>

$$OQ = OV = x + 1$$

    <p>
    Solving the above two equations for \(x\) and \(OV\) we obtain:
    </p>

$$x = \frac {n - 1}{2}$$
$$OV = \frac {n + 1}{2}$$

    <p>
    from where it follows that the long side \(AP\) of the rectangle \(ABTP\) is:
    </p>

$$AP = AO + x =$$
$$OV + x = n$$

    <p>
    from where it follows that the square area of the rectangle \(ABTP\) is
    equal to the square area of the given square \(PQRS\).
    </p>

    <p>
    However, to solve this problem it pays to construct the \(1 \times n\)
    rectangle in such a way that it is contained within the given square as much
    as possible. In terms of the above drawing it means shifting or sliding the
    rectangle \(ABTP\) along \(l\) until its side \(TP\) coincides with the side
    of the given square \(RS\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgsbsquare/bsquare02.png" alt="bsquare02" class="center">

    <p>
    We now observe that the tree points \(A, V, R\), by construction, belong to
    a circumference of \(Circle(O, OR = OV)\), that we already have two line
    segments, \(AV\) and \(VR\), constructed and that the line segment \(AR\) is
    begging to be drawn to complete the \(\triangle ARV\) which, according to
    <strong>B3P31</strong> or <strong>Thales' Theorem</strong>, must be right:
    </p>

    <img src="imgsbsquare/bsquare03.png" alt="bsquare03" class="center">

    <p>
    We observe that the straight line \(p\), passing through \(A\) and \(R\), is
    perpendicular to the line segment \(RV\) and that the bisector \(b\) is also
    perpendicular to the line segment \(RV\). Since now we have a straight line
    passing through \(R\) and \(V\) falling on two straight lines, \(p\) and
    \(b\), in such a way that the corresponding alternate angles are equal because
    they are right, from <strong>B1P27</strong> it follows that \(p\) and \(b\)
    are, in fact, parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, we direct our attention to two pairs of triangles: \(\triangle APD\)
    and \(\triangle ETR\) being the first pair and \(\triangle ABE\) and
    \(\triangle DQR\) being the second pair.
    </p>

    <p>
    Our suspicion is that pairwise these triangles are congruent. Namely,
    \(\triangle APD\) and \(\triangle ETR\) are congruent and so are
    \(\triangle ABE\) and \(\triangle DQR\).
    </p>

    <p>
    By construction the triangles \(APD\) and \(ASR\) are right and they both
    share a common vertex at \(A\). From <strong>B1P32</strong> it follows that
    for the remaining angles of these triangles we have:
    </p>

$$\angle ADP = \angle ARS$$

    <p>
    and by <strong>AAA</strong> \(\triangle APD\) and \(\triangle ASR\) are
    similar. From <strong>B6P4</strong> it follows that the sides about the
    equal angles in these triangles are in the same proportion:
    </p>

$$\frac {PD}{PA} = \frac {SR}{SA}$$
$$PD = PA \times \frac {SR}{SA} = $$
$$(n - \sqrt{n}) \times \frac {\sqrt{n}}{n} =$$
$$\sqrt{n} - 1 = TR$$

    <p>
    from where it follows that:
    </p>

$$QD = \sqrt{n} - PD =$$
$$\sqrt{n} - \sqrt{n} + 1 =$$
$$1 = AB$$

    <p>
    By similar argument we prove that the right, by construction, triangles
    \(ETR\) and \(ASR\) are similar since they share a common vertex at \(R\)
    and hence:
    </p>

$$\frac {TE}{TR} = \frac {SA}{SR}$$
$$TE = TR \times \frac {SA}{SR} = $$
$$(\sqrt{n} - 1) \times \frac {n}{\sqrt{n}} =$$
$$n - \sqrt{n} = PA$$

    <p>
    from where it follows that:
    </p>

$$BE = n - TE =$$
$$n - n + \sqrt{n} =$$
$$\sqrt{n} = QR$$

    <p>
    We now have proven that for two similar right triangles \(APD\) and \(ETR\)
    we have:
    </p>

$$PD = TR$$
$$PA = TE$$

    <p>
    which means that by <strong>SAS</strong> principle these triangles are
    congruent. Further, for two right triangles \(ABE\) and \(DQR\) we have:
    </p>

$$QD = BA$$
$$QR = BE$$

    <p>
    which means that by <strong>SAS</strong> principle these triangles are
    congruent also.
    </p>

    <p>
    Mechanically the above two facts mean that if \(\triangle DQR\) is moved
    down along \(p\) until its vertexes coincide with the corresponding vertexes
    of \(\triangle ABE\) and if \(\triangle ETR\) is moved down \(p\) until its
    vertexes coincide with the corresponding vertexes of \(\triangle APD\) then
    our problem is solved:
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>by cutting the given square in three pieces, \(\triangle DQR\),
    \(\triangle ETR\) and a \(5-\)gon \(PDETS\), the corresponding \(1 \times n\)
    rectangle can be tiled over with these pieces precisely - with no gaps and
    no overlaps
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>The above construction yields the following generic solution for any
    \(n > 1\):
    </p>

    <p>
    - construct the corresponding \(1 \times n\) rectangle in such a way that it
    shares a common right angle at any of four vertexes of the given square
    </p>

    <p>
    - connect the outer, not shared, vertex of the given square, \(R\), diagonally
    with the outer, not shared, vertex of the \(1 \times n\) rectangle, \(A\),
    via a straight line, \(p\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - cut the given square into as many \(1 \times \sqrt{n}\) rectangles starting
    from the side shared with the \(1 \times n\) rectangle as possible - these
    \(1 \times \sqrt{n}\) rectangles will fill the the \(1 \times n\) rectangle
    as much as possible
    </p>

    <p>
    - the last portion of the given square that is not a \(1 \times \sqrt{n}\)
    rectangle will be cut by \(p\) into three pieces that will cover the remaining
    portion of the \(1 \times n\) rectangle
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>For example, for \(\sqrt{2}\) we have:
    </p>

    <img src="imgsbsquare/bsquare04.png" alt="bsquare04" class="center">

    <p>
    For \(\sqrt{3}\) we have:
    </p>

    <img src="imgsbsquare/bsquare05.png" alt="bsquare05" class="center">

    <p>
    For \(\sqrt{4}\) we have:
    </p>

    <img src="imgsbsquare/bsquare06.png" alt="bsquare06" class="center">

    <p>
    For \(\sqrt{5}\) we have:
    </p>

    <img src="imgsbsquare/bsquare07.png" alt="bsquare07" class="center">

    <p>
    and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    We observe that as \(n\) grows the size of \(\triangle DQR\) diminishes while
    the size of \(\triangle ETR\) increases. For:
    </p>

$$n = 4$$

    <p>
    these triangles become congruent and starting with:
    </p>

$$n = 5$$

    <p>
    this process repeats until \(n\) reaches the next perfect square, \(9\), and
    so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    For \(\sqrt{10}\), for example, we have:
    </p>

    <img src="imgsbsquare/bsquare08.png" alt="bsquare08" class="center">

    <p>
    We see that at an intuitive level the above procedure demonstrates that
    only square roots of perfect squares of natural numbers can be rational.
