    <p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg" class="center">
    <dfn>construct an equilateral triangle on the three given parallel straight
    lines</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Process</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    1) Let us use the scope reduction approach. What are the simpler limiting
    cases of the same problem? When the given parallel straight lines are equally
    distanced from each other:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0301.png" alt="RaC0301" class="center">

    <p>
    The solution then is<strong>*</strong>:
    </p>

    <p>
    - choose a point \(A\) at random on any given straight line
    </p>

    <p>
    - construct a perpendicular \(AB\) to that straight line through \(A\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - construct a \(Circle(A, AB) = q\) until it intersects the middle straight
    line at \(C\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - the equilateral triangle \(ABC\) is the one sought-after
    </p>

    <p>
    What other properties of this construction are interesting? The perpendicular
    bisectors to \(AD\) and \(DB\) cut through the middles of \(AC\) and \(CB\).
    \(Circle(B, BD)\) and \(Circle(D, DB)\) intersect at \(E\) which cuts \(CB\)
    in half and lies on \(DB\)'s bisector. Same behavior applies to the circles
    built on the remaining sides \(AC\) and \(CB\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>2) The second limiting case we have is when the middle parallel straight
    line is moved until it coincides with one of the bounding parallel straight
    lines resulting in a two-line formation. How do we construct an equilateral
    triangle then? Here is one way:
    </p>

    <p>
    - choose a point \(A\) on \(l\) at random
    </p>

    <p>
    - construct a perpendicular to \(l\) through \(A\) to locate \(B\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - construct a \(Circle(A, AB) = p\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - construct a \(Circle(B, BA) = q\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(p \cap q = C\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - straight line through \(A\) and \(C\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(\angle BAC = 60^{\circ}\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - bisect \(\angle BAC\) to locate \(D\), the second vertex of the future
    equilateral triangle
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(Circle(A, AD) = s\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(s \cap l = E\) - the third vertex of the equilateral triangle sought-after:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0302.png" alt="RaC0302" class="center">

    <p>
    <br>3) The above construction is rather complicated, \(10\) steps. The simpler
    way would be to construct <dfn>any</dfn> equilateral triangle with two
    arbitrary vertexes on \(l\):
    </p>

    <p>
    - choose the points \(A\) and \(B\) on \(l\) at random
    </p>

    <p>
    - using Euclid's <strong>B1P1</strong> construct an equilateral triangle on
    \(AB\) using Euclid's to locate \(C\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - straight line \(m\) through \(A\) and \(C\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(m \cap l_2 = D\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - construct a \(Circle(A, AD) = q\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(q \cap l = E\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - the equilateral triangle \(ADE\) is the one sought-after:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0303.png" alt="RaC0303" class="center">

    <p>
    This construction is a bit simpler - five steps only.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>4) Now it is more or less clear how to proceed:
    </p>

    <p>
    - choose a point \(A\) on \(l\) at random
    </p>

    <p>
    - construct a perpendicular to \(l\) through \(A\) to locate the points \(B\)
    and \(C\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0304.png" alt="RaC0304" class="center">

    <p>
    <br>Next:
    </p>

    <p>
    - bisect \(AB\) with \(b_1\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - bisect \(BC\) with \(b_2\)
    </p>

    <p>
    We anticipate that the middles of the two sides of the future equilateral
    triangle will be located somewhere on \(b_1\) and \(b_2\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0305.png" alt="RaC0305" class="center">

    <p>
    <br>We can also:
    </p>

    <p>
    - bisect \(AC\) with \(b_3\)
    </p>

    <p>
    We anticipate that the middle of the future equilateral triangle's third side
    should be somewhere on \(b_3\). But that does not seem to give us any advantage.
    </p>

    <p>
    How do we locate any of these middles? Let us draw some more circles centered
    at various points obtained so far and with various radii equal to obtained
    distances:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0306.png" alt="RaC0306" class="center">

    <p>
    The new circles do not seem to add any new clues. Let us compare the last
    construction with the first one. Stop. Wait a second. The two circles
    intersecting at \(D\) look interesting now. The point \(D\) is on the
    perpendicular bisector. This looks familiar. In the first drawing all the
    smaller circles that we constructed cut the sides of the equilateral triangle
    in half.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now let us compare this drawing to our complicated triangle construction on
    just two parallel straight lines. The hunch: the point \(D\) is the middle
    of one of the sides of the future equilateral triangle. Not only that. Further,
    the circles which are used to bisect the common perpendicular \(AB\) seem to
    form an invariant of sort - their intersection always falls on the dead middle
    of one of the sides of the future triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us test this theory on a completely different arrangement of parallel
    straight lines and an already constructed equilateral triangle (we are using
    the reverse order problem-solving approach here):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0307.png" alt="RaC0307" class="center">

    <p>
    This looks plausible and it seems that the circles \(p = Circle(D, DE)\) and
    \(q = Circle(E, ED)\) indeed form an invariant:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>- choose a vertex of the equilateral triangle, \(A\), on any of the
    given parallel straight lines, \(l\) <br>

    <br>- a perpendicular to \(l\) through \(A\) will intersect the remaining
    two given parallel straight lines at \(D\) and \(E\)<br>

    <br>- construct a \(Circle(D, DE) = p\)<br>

    <br>- construct a \(Circle(E, ED) = q\)<br>

    <br>- \(p\) and \(q\) will intersect at the exact middle of the side of the
    equilateral triangle opposite to its chosen vertex, \(A\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>If \(D\) is the middle of one side of the future equilateral triangle
    then we are almost done. Continuing with our process:
    </p>

    <p>
    - construct a straight line \(s\) passing through \(A\) and \(D\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0308.png" alt="RaC0308" class="center">

    <p>
    <br>- construct a perpendicular to \(s\) through \(D\) to locate the remaining
    two vertexes of the equilateral triangle, \(E\) and \(F\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0309.png" alt="RaC0309" class="center">

    <p>
    <br>Cleaning up the construction to contain only the lines that are needed,
    we obtain:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0310.png" alt="RaC0310" class="center">

$$A \in l$$
$$Line(A) \; \bot \; l = B, C$$
$$Circle(C, CB) = p$$
$$Circle(B, BC) = q$$
$$p \cap q = D$$
$$Line(A, D) = s$$
$$Line(D) \; \bot \; s = E, F$$
$$Line(A, E)$$
$$Line(A, F)$$
$$\triangle AFE$$

    <p>
    From <strong>B3P10</strong>, a circle does not cut a circle at more than two
    points, it follows that we will have the second point of intersection of \(p\)
    and \(q\). Consequently, a full solution should include the second equilateral
    triangle symmetrical to the first one about the perpendicular to \(l\) through
    \(A\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0311.png" alt="RaC0311" class="center">

    <p>
    Earlier we have noted that the two-circle invariant is applicable to the
    remaining two given parallel straight lines - will the equilateral
    triangles constructed on them be unique?
    </p>

    <p>
    Here is the construction based on choosing the vertex on the middle given
    parallel straight line, \(l_1\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0312.png" alt="RaC0312" class="center">

    <p>
    Here is the construction based on choosing the vertex on the remaining given
    parallel straight line, \(l_2\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0313.png" alt="RaC0313" class="center">

    <p>
    We see that the resulting equilateral triangles are essentially identical.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Conclusions</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    - it took me about two hours of tinkering with the given arrangement of
    parallel straight lines to work out the solution in several non-continuous
    attempts
    </p>

    <p>
    - I tried several different cases and constructed more lines than were needed
    in the end
    </p>

    <p>
    - the hunch that lead me to a solution was based not on a simpler but rather
    on a more complex construction I did for an equilateral triangle built on two
    parallel straight lines. However, to be perfectly honest, it is still not
    clear to me as to where exactly did that hunch come from
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Proofs, Explanations</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    1) From <strong>B1P1</strong> it follows that the only object needed to
    construct an equilateral triangle on three evenly spaced parallel straight
    lines is a perpendicular through a random point, \(A\), on any one of the
    given straight lines:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0301.png" alt="RaC0301" class="center">

    <p>
    <br>2) Constructing an equilateral triangle on two parallel straight lines.
    </p>

    <p>
    From <strong>B1P1</strong> it follows that by construction:
    </p>

$$\angle BAC = 60^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    and, by construction:
    </p>

$$\angle BAC = 60^{\circ}$$
$$\angle DAC = \angle DAB = 30^{\circ}$$
$$\angle BAE = 90^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    It follows then that:
    </p>

$$\angle EAC = \angle BAE - \angle BAC =$$
$$90^{\circ} - 60^{\circ} = 30^{\circ}$$
$$\angle EAD = \angle EAC + \angle DAC =$$
$$30^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} = 60^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    But \(\triangle EAD\) is isosceles by construction and from
    <strong>B1P5</strong> it follows that the internal angles at its base are
    equal:
    </p>

$$\angle AED = \angle ADE = x$$

    <p>
    From <strong>B1P32</strong> we have:
    </p>

$$\angle EAD + 2x = 180^{\circ}$$
$$x = 60^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    <strong>B1P6</strong> states that if in a triangle two angles equal one
    another, then the sides opposite the equal angles also equal one another.
    Applying this proposition to, for example, angles \(EAD\) and \(EDA\), we
    obtain:
    </p>

$$AE = DE$$

    <p>
    but, by construction:
    </p>

$$AE = AD = r$$

    <p>
    and hence:
    </p>

$$AE = AD = r = DE$$

    <p>
    which means that and according to <strong>B1D20</strong> \(\triangle AED\)
    is equilateral:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0302.png" alt="RaC0302" class="center">

    <p>
    <br>3) Constructing an equilateral triangle on two parallel straight lines.
    </p>

    <p>
    The proof that \(\triangle AED\) is indeed equilateral for this, simpler,
    \(10-\)step, construction is essentially the same as the proof above, just
    shorter. By construction:
    </p>

$$\angle BAC = 60^{\circ}$$
$$AE = AD = r$$

    <p>
    and hence \(\triangle ADE\) is isosceles. From <strong>B1P5</strong> it follows
    that:
    </p>

$$\angle AED = ADE = x$$

    <p>
    and from <strong>B1P32</strong> it follows that:
    </p>

$$\angle EAD + 2x = 180^{\circ}$$
$$x = \angle EAD = \angle BAC = 60^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    From <strong>B1P6</strong>, for angles \(EAD\) and \(EDA\), we obtain: 
    </p>

$$AE = DE$$

    <p>
    but:
    </p>

$$AE = AD = r$$

    <p>
    and hence:
    </p>

$$AE = AD = r = DE$$

    <p>
    and according to <strong>B1D20</strong> \(\triangle AED\) is equilateral:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0303.png" alt="RaC0303" class="center">

    <p>
    <br>4) To prove that the triangle that we have constructed on three arbitrarily
    spaced parallel straight lines is equilateral we will follow the template from
    the previous two proofs: we will first prove that the triangle is isosceles,
    then we will prove that an angle at one of the vertexes is \(60^{\circ}\) and
    then we will apply <strong>B1P6</strong> to appropriate angles to prove that
    all three sides of the triangle are equal.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before we deep dive into the proofs we observe that the angles \(BED\) and
    \(BAD\) subtend the same line segment (chord?) \(BD\) while the angles
    \(AEB\) and \(ADB\) subtend the same line segment (chord?) \(AB\). Could the
    four points \(A, B, D, E\) be concyclic? Let us keep this in the back of our
    minds.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now let us prove that:
    </p>

$$DE = DF$$

    <p>
    From <strong>B1P10</strong> it follows that the point \(D\) is equally
    distanced from \(l_2\) and \(l_3\) which means that if we construct a
    perpendicular to, say, \(l_3\) through \(D\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0314.png" alt="RaC0314" class="center">

    <p>
    then:
    </p>

$$DG = DH$$

    <p>
    Next, consider \(\triangle EGD\) and \(\triangle FHD\) in which, by
    construction, the angles \(EGD\) and \(FHD\) are right and the angles \(EDG\)
    and \(FDH\) are vertical. From <strong>B1P15</strong> it follows that:
    </p>

$$\angle EDG = \angle FDH$$

    <p>
    which means that based on <strong>ASA</strong> congruence principle
    \(\triangle EGD\) and \(\triangle FHD\) are congruent from where it follows
    that:
    </p>

$$EG = FH$$
$$DE = DF$$

    <p>
    Next, let us prove that \(\triangle EAF\) is isosceles. Consider
    \(\triangle ADE\) and \(\triangle ADF\). We just proved that:
    </p>

$$DE = DF$$

    <p>
    The angles \(ADE\) and \(ADF\) are right by construction and so are
    \(\triangle ADE\) and \(\triangle ADF\) which share a common side, \(AD\).
    From <strong>SAS</strong> congruence principle it follows that these two right
    triangles are congruent and:
    </p>

$$AE = AF$$

    <p>
    Lastly, let us prove that:
    </p>

$$\angle AEF = 60^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    Being a composite angle by construction, we represent \(\angle AEF\) as a
    sum of two angles:
    </p>

$$\angle AEF = \alpha + \beta$$

    <p>
    Our idea now is not to compute \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) separately but rather
    prove that their sum must be equal to \(60^{\circ}\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0315.png" alt="RaC0315" class="center">

    <p>
    By construction from <strong>B1P1</strong> it follows that:
    </p>

$$\angle CBD = 60^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    The angle \(CBD\) is also an exterior angle for \(\triangle ABD\). From
    <strong>B1P32</strong>, an exterior angle is the sum of two opposite interior
    angles, we have:
    </p>

$$\angle BAD + \angle BDA = 60^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    What remains to be proven is that:
    </p>

$$\angle BAD = \alpha$$
$$\angle BDA = \beta$$

    <p>
    and that is where our "\(A, B, D, E\) are concyclic" hunch comes in handy
    rendering this proof trivial.
    </p>

    <p>
    We observe that by construction \(\triangle ABE\) and \(\triangle ADE\) are
    right and they also share a common hypotenuse, \(AE\). From
    <strong>B3P31</strong> or <strong>Thales' Theorem</strong> it follows that
    in order to locate the center of a circle whose circumference contains both
    right angles, \(ABE\) and \(ADE\), all we have to do is bisect the line
    segment \(AE\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs03/pserac0316.png" alt="RaC0316" class="center">

    <p>
    This proves that the points \(A, B, D\) and \(E\) are indeed concyclic and
    from <strong>B3P21</strong>, in a circle the angles in the same segment equal
    one another, it follows that since the angles \(BED\) and \(BAD\) both subtend
    the same line segment \(BD\) and the angles \(AEB\) and \(ADB\) both subtend
    the same line segment \(AB\), we have:
    </p>

$$\angle BAD = \alpha$$
$$\angle BDA = \beta$$

    <p>
    which, for the record, proves that:
    </p>

$$\angle AED = 60^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    But \(\triangle EAF\) was proven to be isosceles with:
    </p>

$$AE = AF$$

    <p>
    which means that:
    </p>

$$\angle AED = \angle AFE = 60^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    From <strong>B1P32</strong> it follows that:
    </p>

$$\angle EAF = 60^{\circ}$$

    <p>
    Applying <strong>B1P6</strong> to angles \(EAF\) and \(AFE\) we obtain that:
    </p>

$$AE = FE$$

    <p>
    rendering \(\triangle AEF\), according to <strong>B1D20</strong>, equilateral.
