    <p>
    <br>So far we have used various counting principles to solve various problems
    by crafting a custom tailored chain of reasoning for each problem. Next we
    will look at a number of situations that allow a sweeping generalization to
    be made as long as it is possible to fold a problem into a prepackaged scenario.
    We will mostly use <strong>MCP</strong> to deduce the formulas for these
    scenarios. If it helps, you may think of them as follows - if the counting
    principles are scalpels then the upcoming scenarios are hammers.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us also agree that from now on when we say <dfn>"input items"</dfn> or
    <dfn>"input (multi)set"</dfn> we mean <dfn>"\(n\) items used to construct a
    certain arrangement according to a prescribed rule"</dfn>. Let us name that
    resulting arrangement an <dfn>"output arrangement/(multi)set"</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    When an output arrangement is order-sensitive then we will name it a
    <dfn>permutation</dfn> - as a noun. When an output arrangement is
    order-<strong>in</strong>sensitive then we will name it a
    <dfn>combination</dfn> - also as a noun.
    </p>

    <p>
    We may then think about the upcoming situations as rules or black boxes -
    some number of input items goes in and a certain arrangement comes out.
    Our objective then is:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>find a closed-form formula which will make it possible to find the
    total number of possible arrangements without generating their exhaustive
    list and without calculating that list's size by hand</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    If you stop and think about this for a while it should appear to be nothing
    short of magic.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>4.1.1) (Linear) Permutations of Sets</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We defined a permutation (as a noun) to be such an arrangement of some finite
    number of input items in which order matters. Using:
    </p>

$$S = 123, \; |S| = 3$$

    <p>
    as an example, a permutation (or \(3-\)permutation) of \(S\) is a list of all
    of its items (taken \(n = 3\) at a time) in some order. There are six of those:
    </p>

$$123 \quad 132 \quad 213 \quad 231 \quad 312 \quad 321$$

    <p>
    where the individual subsets:
    </p>

$$123, \; 132, \; 213, \; \dots$$

    <p>
    are <dfn>output arrangements</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    There are six \(2-\)permutations of \(S\):
    </p>

$$12 \quad 21 \quad 13 \quad 31 \quad 23 \quad 32$$

    <p>
    There are three \(1-\)permutations of \(S\):
    </p>

$$1 \quad 2 \quad 3$$

    <p>
    And there is one \(0-\)permutation or an empty set of \(S\).
    </p>

    <p>
    A single permutation of a set then is an output arrangement made up of
    distinct input items in which:
    </p>

    <p>
    - the order of input items matters
    </p>

    <p>
    - no input item may appear more than once (no repetitions)
    </p>

    <p>
    In an exhaustive list of all the permutations of a set:
    </p>

    <p>
    - all the input items must eventually be used
    </p>

    <p>
    - the sizes of the intermediate \(r-\)arrangements are identical - some finite
    arbitrary given ahead of time positive integer \(r\) between zero and \(n
    = |S|\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Scenario:</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>given a set of three digits:

$$1, 2, 3$$

    how many different \(2-\)digit order-sensitive arrangements can be constructed
    if each digit can appear in any single output arrangement only once?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, arrangements like:
    </p>

$$23, \; 32$$

    <p>
    are allowed and are taken to be different while arrangements like:
    </p>

$$123, \; 11$$

    <p>
    are not allowed since the first one is of the wrong size and the second one
    contains illegal duplicates.
    </p>

    <p>
    Formally:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>what is the number of \(r-\)permutations of a set of \(n\) items?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    If we were to construct a single permutation of the above set then with every
    current selection of some item the number of choices for the next selection
    will diminish by one.
    </p>

    <p>
    If we first chose \(1\), for example, then we can not use it again within
    this arrangement - to fill in the next position in a permutation we must choose
    only between the remaining items, \(2\) or \(3\). Once we pick \(2\), for
    example, then we can not use it again within this arrangement - to fill in
    the next position we may now choose only \(3\) and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    In general then for the permutation's first position we choose from \(n\)
    available items, for the permutation's second position we choose from the
    remaining \((n - 1)\) available items, for the third position - from \((n -
    2)\) available items and so on until we are left with \((n - (r - 1))\)
    candidates to choose from for the permutation's \(r-\)th position. Verifying
    that the independence requirement is met, by direct application of
    <strong>MCP</strong>, after making \(r\) consecutive choices we obtain:
    </p>

$$P(n, r) = n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times \dots \times (n - r + 1)$$

    <p>
    To express \(P(n, r)\) in closed form we observe that it has the first \(r\)
    diminishing by one terms starting from \(n\). To turn such an expression into
    a full factorial of \(n\) we have to multiply it by the remaining \((n - r)\)
    diminishing by one terms:
    </p>

$$(n - r) \times (n - r - 1) \times \dots \times 2 \times 1 = (n - r )!$$

    <p>
    To keep \(P(n, r)\) the same we also divide it by the same factor:
    </p>

    <p>
$$P(n, r) = \frac {n \times (n - 1) \times \dots \times (n - r + 1) \times (n - r)
 \times (n - r - 1) \times \dots \times 2 \times 1}{(n - r )!} =
 \frac {n!}{(n - r )!}$$

$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{P(n, r) = \frac {n!}{(n - r )!}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    \(P(n, r)\) is sometimes pronounced <dfn>"\(n\) permute \(r\)"</dfn> and
    there are several alternative notations you may see:
    </p>

$$^nP_r, \; _nP_r, \; P_r^n$$

    <p>
    and the like.
    </p>

    <p>
    For the record we note the edge conditions: 
    </p>

$$P(n, 0) = 1$$
$$P(n, 1) = n$$
$$P(n, n) = n!$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Example E12</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>How many different \(|S|-\)sized "words", including the nonsensical ones,
    can be made from a set of letters:</dfn>
    </p>

$$S = \{m, a, t, h \}$$

    <p>
    From (1) it follow that the answer is:
    </p>

$$P(4, 4) = 4! = 24$$

    <p>
    different 4-letter "words".
    </p>

    <p>
    One way to create an exhaustive list of all such "words" is to interpret
    <strong>MCP</strong> literally. After making the first choice, a letter
    \(m\), \(3\) more letters remain. Write down as many \(m\)s as there are
    remaining choices for the second letter:
    </p>

$$m \quad m \quad  m$$

    <p>
    For each \(m\) make a choice for the second letter:
    </p>

$$ma \quad mt \quad mh$$

    <p>
    Two choices remain for the third letter <dfn>for each ordered pair</dfn>
    recorded so far - pick one such pair and add these choices to the list by
    turning one ordered pair into two ordered \(3-\)tuples:
    </p>

$$\underbrace{mat \quad  mah} \quad mt \quad mh$$

    <p>
    pick the next pair:
    </p>

$$mat \quad mah \quad \underbrace{mta \quad mth} \quad mh$$

    <p>
    and the last one:
    </p>

$$mat \quad mah \quad mta \quad mth \quad \underbrace{mha \quad mht}$$

    <p>
    Now only one choice remains for the fourth letter:
    </p>

$$math \quad maht \quad mtah \quad mtha \quad mhat \quad mhta$$

    <p>
    which concludes the sequence of choices driven by the first letter. Since
    three such choices remain - \(a, t, h\) - repeat the above process three
    more times:
    </p>

$$math \quad maht \quad mtah \quad mtha \quad mhat \quad mhta$$
$$amth \quad amht \quad atmh \quad athm \quad ahmt \quad ahtm$$
$$tamh \quad tahm \quad tmah \quad tmha \quad tham \quad thma$$
$$hamt \quad hatm \quad hmat \quad hmta \quad htam \quad htma$$

    <p>
    We thus construct \(4\) rows containing \(6\) columns each or a total of
    \(24 = 4!\) \(4-\)letter "words".
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Example E13</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>If we take a standard deck of cards to be our "alphabet" then how many
    different \(52-\)card "words" can be made from it?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    From (1) it follow that the answer is:
    </p>

$$P(52, 52) = 52!$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Example E14</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>How many different \(16-\)ball "words" can be made if all the \(16\)
    billiard balls are used?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Again:
    </p>

$$P(16, 16) = 16!$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Example E15</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>How many different \(2-\)permutations of the set "\(math\)" are
    possible?</dfn>
    </p>

$$P(4, 2) = \frac {4!}{(4 - 2)!} = 12$$

    <p>
    or:
    </p>

$$ma \quad mt \quad mh$$
$$am \quad at \quad ah$$
$$tm \quad ta \quad th$$
$$hm \quad ha \quad ht$$

    <p>
    There should be \(4\) rows containing \(3\) columns each for a total of
    \(12\) \(2-\)permutations.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>4.1.2) Circular Permutations</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    If we bend our (normally) linear arrangement of items into a <dfn>circular</dfn>
    arrangement - how many of these are possible if the circle must remain fixed
    in its plane?
    </p>

    <p>
    Fix an orthogonal \(xyz\) coordinate system in space. Pick the \(xOy\) plane.
    In that plane fix a circle centered at the origin \(O\). Glue the items onto
    the circumference of the circle and rotate that circle about the \(z\) axis.
    Then even though the (absolute) \((x, y)\) coordinates of the items will
    change from one rotation to the other their relative position with respect
    to each other will not since the motion is rigid. As such, the new
    arrangements will still be considered "the same" since the items' immediate
    "left" and "right" neighbors will remain the same.
    </p>

    <p>
    In other words two circular permutations are different if one can not be
    obtained from the other via the rotation process described above. In the
    drawing below the arrangements in Fig. <strong>A</strong> are the same
    while the arrangements in Fig. <strong>B</strong> are different:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/kp09.png" class="center">

    <p>
    To deduce the formula for this case we observe that many linear arrangements
    correspond to one circular arrangement. If we pick any one linear arrangement
    and keep shifting its items by just one position in some constant direction
    until each item again occupies its original position then we will obtain all
    the linear arrangements corresponding to one circular arrangement meaning that
    we will find all the linear arrangements that will not compare "different"
    when bent into a circle.
    </p>

    <p>
    Using "\(math\)" linear arrangement, for example, let us always shift its
    items Westward one at a time. When an item falls off one edge of the
    \(4-\)position arrangement we grab it and place it into a position
    corresponding to the opposite edge of the arrangement:
    </p>

$$math \quad athm \quad thma \quad hmat$$

    <p>
    We see that there will always be \(4 = n\) such arrangements. We now go back
    to our original set of \(24\) linear permutations, partition it in such a
    way that each subset contains exactly \(4\) linear permutations that will
    not compare "different" if bent into a circle and by <strong>DCP</strong> we
    obtain that:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{\frac {P(n, n)}{n} = (n - 1)!}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    is the number of circular permutations of \(n\) distinct items. This informal
    proof also provides a way to generate circular permutations: with our
    permutations generation approach these will be the \(6\) items in Fig.
    <strong>B</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    If we look closely at Fig. <strong>B</strong> - which other combinatorial
    reasoning can be suggested to prove the above formula?
    </p>

    <p>
    Hint:
    </p>

    <p id="hint">
    MCP
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>4.1.3) Interbucket Distributions</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    \(P(n, r)\) is applicable to the distribution of \(r\) distinct items among
    \(n\) distinct buckets with the following restrictions:
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>4.1.3.1)</strong> each item must be in some bucket
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>4.1.3.1)</strong> at most one item per bucket is allowed
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>4.1.3.1)</strong> the order of items across the buckets matters;
    </p>

    <p>
    For a proof we observe that we have \(n\) buckets to choose from for the
    placement of the first item, \((n - 1)\) buckets to choose from for the
    placement of the second item and so on until we have \((n - r + 1)\) buckets
    left to choose from for the placement of the \(r-\)th item. By
    <strong>MCP</strong> then the number of such distributions is \(P(n, r)\).
    </p>

    <p>
    As an exercise write down all \(6\) distributions of two items, \(a\) and
    \(c\), among \(3\) buckets: \(b_1, b_2, b_3\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>4.2.1) Combinations</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We defined a combination (as a noun) to be such an arrangement of some finite
    number of input items in which order does not matter. We can say then that a
    combination is a permutation whose <dfn>order matters</dfn> requirement was
    removed. Using:
    </p>

$$S = \{1, 2, 3 \}$$

    <p>
    as an example, there is only one \(3-\)combination of \(S\):
    </p>

$$123$$

    <p>
    There are three \(2-\)combinations of \(S\):
    </p>

$$12 \quad 13 \quad 23$$

    <p>
    There are three \(1-\)combinations of \(S\):
    </p>

$$1 \quad 2 \quad 3$$

    <p>
    And there is one \(0-\)combination or an empty set of \(S\).
    </p>

    <p>
    The above \(r-\)combinations are generally taken to be the subsets of \(S\)
    so instead of saying "\(r-\)combination" we may also say "\(r-\)subset" or
    simply "subset".
    </p>

    <p>
    A single combination of a set then is an output arrangement made up of
    distinct input items in which:
    </p>

    <p>
    - the order of items does not matter
    </p>

    <p>
    - no input item may appear more than once (no repetitions)
    </p>

    <p>
    In an exhaustive list of all the combinations of a set:
    </p>

    <p>
    - all the input items must eventually be used
    </p>

    <p>
    - the sizes of the intermediate \(r-\)arrangements are identical - some finite
    arbitrary given ahead of time positive integer \(r\) between zero and \(n =
    |S|\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Scenario:</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>given a set of three digits:

$$1, 2, 3$$

    how many different \(2\)-digit order-<strong>in</strong>sensitive arrangements
    can be constructed if each digit can appear in any one output arrangement
    only once?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, arrangements like:
    </p>

$$12 \quad 21$$

    <p>
    are allowed but are taken to be the same while arrangements like:
    </p>

$$11 \quad 123$$

    <p>
    are not allowed since the first one contains illegal duplicates and the
    second one is of the wrong size.
    </p>

    <p>
    Formally:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>what is the number of \(r-\)subsets of a set of \(n\) items?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    To deduce the formula for this case we temporarily cancel the "order does not
    matter" requirement - an approach popular in solving combinatorial problems.
    Then the type of arrangements that we are dealing with is permutations and
    by the previous scenario, permutations of sets, the number of possible
    \(r-\)permutations of such items, from (1), is \(P(n, r)\).
    </p>

    <p>
    We next observe that the construction of each such \(r-\)permutation can be
    broken into two consecutive events:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) choosing \(r\) items from \(n\) items
    </p>

    <p>
    2) arranging the chosen items in some order
    </p>

    <p>
    The number of outcomes of the first event is what we are after - let us name
    it \(C(n, r)\). The number of outcomes of the second event we already know -
    if we put:
    </p>

$$n = r$$

    <p>
    then from (1) it is:
    </p>

$$P(r, r) = r!$$

    <p>
    We verify the independence requirement and by <strong>MCP</strong> we obtain:
    </p>

$$P(n, r) = C(n, r) \times r!$$

    <p>
    or:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{C(n, r) = \frac{P(n, r)}{r!} = \frac{n!}{r! (n - r)!}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    \(C(n, r)\) is sometimes pronounced <dfn>"\(n\) choose \(r\)"</dfn> and there
    are several alternative notations you may see:
    </p>

$$^nC_r, \quad _nC_r, \quad C_r^n, \quad \Big(_r^n \Big)$$

    <p>
    and the like.
    </p>

    <p>
    For the record we note the edge conditions:
    </p>

$$C(n, 0) = 1$$
$$C(n, 1) = n$$
$$C(n, n) = 1$$

    <p>
    We should have no problems figuring out how to generate an exhaustive list
    of all the possible combinations of a set by hand. One way to do that is to
    fall back on the previously solved problem of generating all the permutations
    of a set and then reduce its solution set by throwing out all the duplicates.
    For our sample \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) problem we obtain:
    </p>

$$12 \quad 13 \quad 23$$

    <p>
    or:
    </p>

$$C(3, 2) = \frac {3!}{2!(3 - 2)!} = 3$$

    <p>
    \(2-\)combinations.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Example E16</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>\(17\) points are sprinkled on a plane in such a way that no three are
    collinear. How many straight lines can be drawn through these points?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Since a straight line is uniquely determined by a pair of points regardless
    of their order in the pair then the answer is the number of \(2-\)subsets of
    \(17\) items:
    </p>

$$C(17, 2) = \frac{17!}{2!15!} = 136$$

    <p>
    straight lines.
    </p>

    <p>
    What about the number of triangles?
    </p>

$$C(17, 3) = \frac{17!}{3! 14!} = 680$$

    <p>
    \(C(n, r)\)s are also known as <dfn>Binomial Coefficients</dfn> - they are
    used in the expansion of the expressions of the following form:
    </p>

$$(x + y)^n$$

    <p>
    The values for various \(C(n, r)\)s can be found with <dfn>Pascal's
    Triangle</dfn>. \(C(n, r)\)s show up in solutions of many seemingly unrelated
    problems across many seemingly unrelated fields. See, for example, <strong>Two
    Eggs</strong> problem in <strong>Reverse Order</strong> section under
    <strong>Basic Approaches</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    \(C(n, r)\)s have many interesting properties which you are encouraged to
    investigate on your own. We will mention just two - the Symmetry Property
    and the Number of Subsets.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>4.2.2) Symmetry Property</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Recall our complement sets discussion in <strong>SCP</strong> section where
    we noted that a subset of \(S\) that contains all but \(r\) items is uniquely
    determined by the very \(r\) items that are not in it. In fact nothing prevents
    us from switching the notations around - we can claim \(A^c\) to be the
    original set and \(A\) to be its complement, formally:
    </p>

$$(A^c)^c = A$$

    <p>
    It follows then that the number of ways in which \((n - r)\) items can be
    chosen from a set of \(n\) is exactly the same as the number of ways in which
    \(r\) items can be chosen from the same set:
    </p>

$$C(n, n - r) = \frac {n!}{(n - r)! (n - n + r)!} = \frac {n!}{r!(n - r)!} =
 C(n, r)$$

    <p>
    The above property is sometimes called the <dfn>Symmetry Property of
    \(C(n, r)\)</dfn> and we can rewrite it as follows:
    </p>

$$from \; \; n = a + b \; \Rightarrow \; C(n, a) = C(n, b)$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>4.2.3) Number of Subsets</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us now ask ourselves - what is the total number of subsets of a set of
    \(n\) items?
    </p>

    <p>
    Here by subsets we mean all the possible subsets: \(0-\)subsets, \(1-\)subsets,
    \(2-\)subsets and so on. On the one hand, we can answer that question via
    <strong>MCP</strong>. Our first input item can either be in the output subset
    or not - two choices only. Regardless of the previous choice the second input
    item can either be in the output subset or not - again, two choices only. By
    applying this logic to the remaining input items in the set, from
    <strong>MCP</strong> it follows that:

$$\underbrace{2 \times 2 \times 2 \times \dots \times 2}_{n} = 2^n$$

    <p>
    is the total number of all the subsets of a set.
    </p>

    <p>
    On the other hand, we can always partition the output set of all the subsets
    of the input set in such a way that each item of the output set represents
    exactly one \(r-\)subset. For example:
    </p>

$$S_i = \{a, b, c \}$$
$$S_o = \{\{\}, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{ab\}, \{ac\}, \{bc\}, \{abc\}\}$$

    <p>
    Since the number of such \(r-\)subsets is given by \(C(n, r)\), from
    <strong>ACP</strong> it follows that the sum of \(C(n, r)\)s for all the
    \(r\)s is also the answer to the above question:
    </p>

$$C(n, 0) + C(n, 1) + C(n, 2) + \dots + C(n, n) = 2^n = (1 + 1)^n$$

    <p>
    If we require the number of <dfn>non-empty</dfn> subsets then it is:
    </p>

$$2^n - 1$$

    <p>
    This task of counting the number of subsets in a set also opens the door
    for <dfn>recurrence relations</dfn> and <dfn>generating functions</dfn> ideas
    that are not discussed in this tutorial.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>4.2.3) Interbucket Distributions</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    \(C(n, r)\) is applicable to the distribution of \(r\)
    <dfn>indistinguishable</dfn> items among \(n\) distinct buckets with the
    following restrictions:
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>4.2.3.1)</strong> each item must be in some bucket
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>4.2.3.2)</strong> at most one item per bucket is allowed
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>4.2.3.3)</strong> the concept of order of items across the buckets
    does not apply
    </p>

    <p>
    For a proof we observe that since all the input items are indistinguishable,
    for a unique description of any given distribution all we need is bucket
    numbers that have exactly one item in them because each bucket's number from
    \(N\) is unique. We then throw out the original input items and make the
    buckets' numbers our new input items. The problem then is rephrased as:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>in how many ways \(r\) items can be chosen out of \(n\)?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    But we already know the answer to that question:
    </p>

$$C(n, r)$$

    <p>
    As an exercise write down all \(3\) distributions of two \(a\)s among \(3\)
    buckets \(b_1, b_2, b_3\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Before we conclude this section we note that when it comes to indistinguishable
    input items the multifaceted \(C(n, r)\) has yet another interpretation, see
    <strong>5.1.2</strong> section, permutations of multisets with finite supply.
