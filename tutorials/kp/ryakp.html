    <br><strong>1) Purpose</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Since academic information is highly hierarchical, it is vital to be introduced
    to the very basic ideas in any given discipline before moving on to bigger and
    better things. However, sometimes it so happens that these basic ideas are not
    introduced in high (or middle) school in the hope that "it will be taught in
    college" and sometimes these ideas are not mentioned in college on the
    assumption that "it was supposed to be studied in high (or middle) school".
    This phenomenon is less likely to occur in such disciplines as geometry,
    algebra or physics but, based on my personal experience, it is more likely to
    occur in combinatorial analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
    As such, the purpose of this tutorial is to cover this potential gap by
    exploring the five basic counting principles and four basic problem types -
    permutations and combinations with and without repetitions which, while giving
    an introduction to the discipline, can be used to solve a wide range of the
    entry level combinatorial problems.
    </p>

    <p>
    Full disclosure:
    </p>

    <p>
    I do not claim to have obtained any of the upcoming results. The information
    presented here is so basic that it can be treated as tribal knowledge passed
    by word of mouth from generation to generation. My only input is the
    organization of the material - thinking of and gathering all the relevant
    pieces in one place and a slightly more lengthy than usual treatment of the
    basic concepts of items, comparison and order.
    </p>
 
    <p>
    <br><strong>2) Lingo</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In the modern branches of Mathematics (and Physics) it has become customary
    to not define certain basic or fundamental concepts since, as the wisdom of
    ages teaches us, it is simply impossible to define such concepts in a totally
    unambiguous way, without circular references.
    </p>

    <p>
    In his axiomatization of Geometry, for example, Hilbert did not define such
    fundamental geometric objects as <strong>point</strong>, <strong>straight
    line</strong> and <strong>plane</strong>. In various Mathematical Analysis
    and Number Theory courses the concept of <strong>number</strong> is not
    defined - we are given <dfn>descriptions</dfn> of various <dfn>types</dfn>
    of numbers - <dfn>whole, rational, irrational, real, complex, prime, even,
    odd</dfn>, etc. but we dare not to ask what that object that we refer to
    as <dfn>number</dfn> actually <dfn>is</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    On a similar note, when in Physics we ask "What <strong>time</strong> or
    <strong>space</strong> is?" we are usually told what the object in question
    <dfn>does</dfn>, <dfn>flows</dfn> or <dfn>bends/curves</dfn>, but not what
    it actually <dfn>is</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In Combinatorial Analysis we will use such fundamental concepts as
    <strong>item, order, set</strong>. It is best to state explicitly early on
    that we will not attempt to define these concepts but will rather present a
    <dfn>description</dfn> of these concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>2.1) Item</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    An <dfn>item</dfn> is anything we want it to be. Item's synonyms are
    <dfn>object, entity, element, member</dfn>. An item is a rather sweeping and
    an all encompassing abstraction birthed by the given problem. For example: a
    letter, a word, a digit, a number, a marble, a bowl of marbles, a star, a
    constellation and so on, are all items.
    </p>

    <p>
    For any two items \(a\) and \(b\) we define an operation of
    <dfn>primitive comparison</dfn> which for our purposes yields only one of
    only two mutually exclusive outcomes:
    </p>

    <p>
    - <dfn>"equal"</dfn>, these two items are identical or the same
    </p>

    <p>
    - <dfn>"not equal"</dfn>, these two items are different or distinct
    </p>

    <p>
    Consequently, let us call the <dfn>"equal"</dfn> items
    <dfn>indistinguishable</dfn> and let us call the items that are <dfn>"not
    equal"</dfn> <dfn>distinct</dfn>. Formally:
    </p>

$$a = b$$
$$a \neq  b$$

    <p>
    where the "equal" and "not equal" signs absorb the arbitrary definition of
    comparison.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, in one case an item "spoon" may be "equal" to another item,
    "fork", because their commonality, in the current context, is based on the
    intended usage of these items and then, based on that criteria of comparison,
    "spoon" is "not equal" to "barbell".
    </p>

    <p>
    In a different case "spoon" may very well be "equal" to "barbell" because both
    items are made out of metal and, since the material of which the items are
    made is the base for commonality in this particular context, "spoon" is "not
    equal" to "fork" because "fork" is plastic.
    </p>

    <p>
    An early lesson to take away from this is that in combinatorial analysis
    things change very quickly and very easily. In an academic parlance we would
    say that, in general, Combinatorial Analysis is a <dfn>low constraint</dfn>
    discipline. Further, it may be beneficial to attach a concept of
    <dfn>property</dfn> to an item. Any given item may have multiple properties
    but items' comparison should be performed on one property at a time basis.
    </p>

    <p>
    Though there are always exceptions to the rules, generally - <dfn>within the
    boundaries of the current problem</dfn> or <dfn>once the problem statement
    has been formulated</dfn> - we take it that the individual items become and
    stay <dfn>fixed</dfn> or <dfn>frozen</dfn> qualitywise, meaning that they:
    </p>

    <p>
    - preserve their identity and do not morph into something else entirely
    </p>

    <p>
    - remain wholesome - undividible any further
    </p>

    <p>
    for the "duration" of a given problem.
    </p>

    <p>
    A multitude of such items forms a <dfn>collection</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>2.2) Collection</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    A <dfn>collection</dfn> is a multitude of items that have something in common.
    That commonality can be long lasting or it can be temporary and fleeting.
    </p>

    <p>
    Collections are very flexible, fluid and dynamic - items can be thrown out
    of or into a collection any time we want. All the items in a collection are
    considered to be <dfn>equivalent</dfn> for the counting purposes - even if
    an item <dfn>"apple"</dfn> is different from an item <dfn>"orange"</dfn> when
    compared based on its look and feel - still both items are <dfn>fruits</dfn>
    and hence can be treated uniformly when counted.
    </p>

    <p>
    Collection's synonyms are <dfn>list, group, pile, assortment, arrangement</dfn>.
    A sample collection, for example, can be an assortment of characters in your
    favorite language that amounts to a meaningful word:
    </p>

$$S = \{m, a, t, h\}$$

    <p>
    or not a meaningful "word":
    </p>

$$S = \{h, t, a, m\}$$

    <p>
    Here \(S\) is a shorthand notation for a collection. The braces \(\{\) and
    \(\}\) delineate the boundaries of a collection. The commas \(,\) delineate
    the boundaries of the items within a collection and the braces do so for
    the first and the last items. There are other ways to specify a collection
    but the one above is all we will need.
    </p>

    <p>
    To save us some typing we will avoid the braces and the commas often - when
    the items are single digits or letters.
    </p>

    <p>
    For any two collections we define an operation of <dfn>aggregate
    comparison</dfn> as follows. We assume that a collection of natural numbers
    \(N\)  is already given to us, axiomatically perhaps. We represent an
    arbitrary collection of items <dfn>conceptually</dfn> as a tight series of
    buckets \([ \; ]\) with no space in between them. The sample:
    </p>

$$math$$

    <p>
    collection then temporarily becomes:
    </p>

$$S = \{[ \; ] \; [ \; ] \; [ \; ] \; [ \; ]\}$$

    <p>
    To each consecutive bucket we assign one consecutive natural number. Which
    <dfn>end</dfn> or <dfn>extremity</dfn> of the collection we start this
    <dfn>enumeration</dfn> process from does not really matter as long as we are
    consistent across the operations on multiple collections. We can enumerate
    the items <dfn>right-to-left</dfn> or <dfn>left-to-right</dfn>. It also does
    not really matter which integer we assign to the very <dfn>first</dfn> bucket.
    Traditionally we start with a \(1\) and we move <dfn>left-to-right</dfn>:
    </p>

$$S = \{[ \; ]_1 \; [ \; ]_2 \; [ \; ]_3 \; [ \; ]_4\}$$

    <p>
    Into each bucket in a collection we place exactly one item:
    </p>

$$S = \{[m]_1 \; [a]_2 \; [t]_3 \; [h]_4 \}$$

    <p>
    and introduce the following notations:
    </p>

$$|S| = 4$$
$$S[3] = a_3 = t$$

    <p>
    The vertical bars mean <dfn>"the number of items in a collection"</dfn> or
    collection's <dfn>"size"</dfn> or <dfn>"length"</dfn> which is four in this
    case.
    </p>

    <p>
    The square brackets mean <dfn>"the contents of the bucket whose ordinal
    position within the collection is given"</dfn> which in this case is \(t\)
    since in \(S\) it is in the bucket number three.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since our bucket-based representation of a collection is only conceptual, we
    will still use the traditional notation to record a collection:
    </p>

$$S = \{m, a, t, h\}$$

    <p>
    but if and when needed the square brackets notation gives us a way to reference
    items in a collection located in an arbitrary bucket number \(j\) as:
    </p>

$$S[ j ], \; j = 1, 2, \dots , |S|$$

    <p>
    To be perfectly clear - <dfn>"bucket's contents", "bucket's number"</dfn> and
    <dfn>"number of buckets"</dfn> in a collection are three different things.
    </p>

    <p>
    We can now compare any two collections \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) by comparing their
    items in the corresponding buckets as long as buckets from each collection
    are available:
    </p>

$$S_1[ j ] = S_2[ j ] \quad \forall \;  j = 1, \dots , min(|S_1|, |S_2|)$$

    <p>
    where the symbol \(\forall\)  means "for all" or "for any" or "for each".
    </p>

    <p>
    If the above statement is true for all \(j\)s and:
    </p>

$$|S_1| = |S_2|$$

    <p>
    then these collections are indistinguishable (the same) and distinct (different)
    otherwise. In the latter case the collections may be of different sizes or
    they may be of equal size but of different contents for some corresponding
    buckets. For example, these collections:
    </p>

$$S_1 = mathematika$$
$$S_2 = math$$

    <p>
    are different because their sizes are different - we do not even have to look
    at buckets' contents. These collections:
    </p>

$$S_1 = math$$
$$S_2 = maht$$

    <p>
    have the same size but they are still different because the contents of the
    bucket three in each collection are different. These collections are the same:
    </p>

$$S_1 = math$$
$$S_2 = math$$

    <p>
    Just like the primitive comparison of two items, the aggregate comparison of
    two collections also yields only one of only two mutually exclusive outcomes,
    of which the positive one can occur only if both collections are of the same
    size. We did this on purpose - if we always compare collections comprised of
    the same items, implying - of equal sizes, a frequent task in Kombinatorix
    Primordial, than the only thing that matters is the <dfn>order</dfn> of these
    items within the collection.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>2.3) Order</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We may say that order is <dfn>an arbitrary rule used to control the population
    of a collection</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    For integers, for example, such a rule may be based on the operation of
    comparison which yields one of three possible outcomes - a given integer is
    less than, equal to or greater than some other integer. In Kombinatorix
    Primordial, however, we shall use a bit different flavor of order - its numbed
    down, one of two outcomes, version described above.
    </p>

    <p>
    To sum it up: for us an order is something that makes two collections comprised
    of the same items different.
    </p>

    <p>
    We have done all this work so that it becomes easier to comprehend the meaning
    of the question <dfn>"does order matter?"</dfn> where order is to be understood
    in the sense described above.
    </p>

    <p>
    Every case is different so the generic answer to the above question - it depends.
    If a sports commentator reports on the results of some competition then the
    following three collections comprised of the same items \(1, 2, 3\):
    </p>

$$123 \quad 321 \quad 213$$

    <p>
    can be considered the same, collapsed into and counted as one. Why? Because
    regardless of how the report is delivered to the audience, the person who
    took the first place will always be attached to a gold medal (even if announced
    <dfn>last</dfn>), the person who took the second place will always be attached
    to a silver medal and so on. In that case we would say that <dfn>"order does
    not matter"</dfn> though based on the aggregate comparison procedure described
    above these collections are, strictly speaking, not identical - a fact we are
    willing to ignore in this particular case.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, when it comes to passwords, house numbers or apartment numbers within
    a house, salaries, dates and times, a book's page numbers, serial and version
    numbers or mileage on our car's odometers then all three collections are
    different and we must count them as three separate entities. In that case we
    would say that <dfn>"order matters"</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>2.4) Repetitions</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In a multitude of items it can so happen that one or more items are <dfn>"the
    same"</dfn> - exact copies of each other - when an item to item comparison
    within a collection yields "equal to". We call these items indistinguishable:
    </p>

$$122333$$

    <p>
    In this collection we have two indistinguishable items: \(2\), repeated twice,
    and \(3\), repeated trice. When the presence of such items in a collection is
    allowed it is sometimes said that <dfn>repetitions are allowed</dfn>. To
    avoid the potential ambiguities in this case we will introduce the notion of
    a <dfn>type</dfn> of an item. We will then say that an item of type \(2\),
    for example, is repeated this many times and that an item of type \(3\) is
    repeated that many times.
    </p>

    <p>
    When <dfn>repetitions are not allowed</dfn> then all the items in a collection
    must be <dfn>unique</dfn> or <dfn>distinct</dfn>. The items can be distinct
    <dfn>a priory</dfn> or simply given to us that way or <dfn>we can always make
    a finite number of indistinguishable items distinct</dfn> if and when needed.
    We accomplish this task in the way similar to the one we used to enumerate
    the buckets in a collection - we:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg" class="center">
    <dfn>assign consecutive natural numbers to each indistinguishable item</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    For future reference let us refer to the above as <strong>2.4</strong>
    procedure.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, let us assume that we have five indistinguishable items:
    </p>

$$\{a, a, a, a, a\}$$

    <p>
    To make these items distinct we start with an item at one extremity of the
    collection and assign \(1\) to it in the form of a subscript. We then move
    on to the <dfn>next</dfn> item in the collection and assign \(2\) to it and
    so on until we reach the opposite extremity of the collection at which point
    all the items will be distinct:
    </p>

$$a_1 \neq  a_2 \neq  a_3 \neq  a_4 \neq  a_5$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>2.5) Set, Multiset</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us combine all the previous concepts and describe a special collection in
    which:
    </p>

    <p>
    - the order of items does not matter and
    </p>

    <p>
    - duplicate items are ignored
    </p>

    <p>
    Such a collection is called a <dfn>set</dfn>. As such these two sets are one
    and the same:
    </p>

$$\{a, b, b, c, c, c\} \quad \{c, b, a\}$$

    <p>
    To avoid confusion do realize that when earlier we said "repetitions are
    allowed" it is <dfn>generally</dfn>, emphasis on generally, understood that
    we are not just wasting our breath - we are implying that the allowed
    duplicate items are to be counted toward some grand total. These duplicate
    items are not just hanging out there, loitering and doing nothing. They are
    there for a reason - to be used and counted.
    </p>

    <p>
    In sets, however, though mechanically we <dfn>may</dfn> add duplicates to
    our collection - in the end we will ignore them - meaning we will not use
    them so we might as well throw all the duplicate items out and condense our
    collection to distinct items only.
    </p>

    <p>
    A collection in which:
    </p>

    <p>
    - the order of items does not matter but
    </p>

    <p>
    - duplicate items <dfn>are</dfn> counted
    </p>

    <p>
    is called a <dfn>multiset</dfn> designating which it is customary to precede
    each item with its <dfn>repetition number</dfn>:
    </p>

$$\{1*a, 2*b, 3*c\}$$

    <p>
    Sets can be, among other operations, glued together (unionized) or
    intersected.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>2.5.1) Union</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    A <dfn>union</dfn> of two sets, designated as:
    </p>

$$S_1 \cup  S_2$$

    <p id="dbg" class="center">
    <dfn>is yet another set made up of items that belong to either set \(S_1\)
    or to set \(S_2\) or to both sets</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Graphically unions, and other constructs, are represented as <dfn>Venn
    Diagrams</dfn>. Let a set \(S_1\) represent <dfn>"all spoons"</dfn> and
    let \(S_2\) represent <dfn>"all ceramic objects"</dfn>. The union of these
    two sets then is the plane region occupied by both circles including the
    overlapping section that represents <dfn>"ceramic spoons"</dfn>:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/kp01.png" alt="kp 01" class="center">

    <p>
    In another, more formal, example:
    </p>

$$S_1 = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$$
$$S_2 = \{x, y, z\}$$
$$S_1 \cup  S_2 = \{1, 2, 3, 4, x, y, z\}$$

    <p>
    It is possible to extend the above definition of a union to an arbitrary
    finite number of sets from where we conclude that for an item to be in a
    union of some number of sets it must belong to at least one set.
    </p>

    <p>
    Intuitively then, we may say that unions are <dfn>inclusive</dfn> and that
    they relate to a logical <strong>OR</strong> operator.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>2.5.2) Intersection</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    An <dfn>intersection</dfn> of two sets, designated as:
    </p>

$$S_1 \cap S_2$$

    <p id="dbg" class="center">
    <dfn>is yet another set made up of items that belong to \(S_1\) and to
    \(S_2\) simultaneously</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Using the graphical example from the Union section, an intersection of its
    two sets will be only the overlapping section of two circles, representing
    just <dfn>"ceramic spoons"</dfn> - and nothing else:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/kp02.png" alt="kp 02" class="center">

    <p>
    In another, more formal, example:
    </p>

$$S_1 = \{1, 2, 3, 4, z\}$$
$$S_2 = \{4, x, y, z\}$$
$$S_1 \cap  S_2 = \{4, z\}$$

    <p>
    We can extend the above definition of an intersection to an arbitrary finite
    number of sets from which we conclude that for an item to be in an
    intersection of some number of sets it must belong to each and every set.
    </p>

    <p>
    Intuitively then, we may say that intersections are <dfn>exclusive</dfn> and
    that they relate to a logical <strong>AND</strong> operator.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>2.5.3) Empty Set</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    A set with no items is called an <dfn>empty</dfn> or <dfn>null</dfn> set
    designated as \(\{\}\) or \(\emptyset\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>2.5.4) Disjoint Sets</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Two sets with no common items, \(abc\) and \(defg\) for example, are called
    <dfn>disjoint</dfn>. From the above definitions it follows that the
    intersection of such two sets is an empty set. Formally:
    </p>

$$S_1 \cap  S_2 = \{\}$$

    <p>
    If we want to say that <dfn>"none of \(n\) sets have any items in common"</dfn>
    then we would say that they are <dfn>"disjoint pairwise"</dfn> meaning that
    if we pick any two distinct sets then they will be disjoint. Formally:
    </p>

$$\forall \;  j, k \in  [1 \dots n], \; j \neq  k \quad S_j \cap S_k = \{\}$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>2.5.5) Partition</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Earlier we noted that an item can be anything we want - why not another set?
    If we take an existing set:
    </p>

$$S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$$

    <p>
    and rearrange it in such a way that each and every of its items belongs to
    exactly one <dfn>subset</dfn>:
    </p>

$$\{\{1\}, \{2, 3, 4\}, \{5, 6\}, \{7, 8, 9\}\}$$

    <p>
    then the subsets:
    </p>

$$\{1\}$$
$$\{2, 3, 4\}$$
$$\{5, 6\}$$
$$\{7, 8, 9\}$$

    <p>
    are disjoint pairwise and we would say that they form a <dfn>partition</dfn>
    (as a noun) of \(S\). When we use the word <dfn>partition</dfn> as a verb
    then it means <dfn>"take action"</dfn> and rearrange the given set into a
    number of subsets disjoint pairwise.

    For comparison:
    </p>

$$\{\{1\}, \{2, 3, 4\}, \{5, 6\}, \{7, 9\}\}$$

    <p>
    is not a partition of \(S\). Why? Because the item \(8\) was left out in the
    cold, hanging high and dry.
    </p>

$$\{\{1\}, \{2, 3, 4\}, \{5, 6\}, \{6, 7, 8, 9\}\}$$

    <p>
    is also not a partition of \(S\) since these two greedy subsets:
    </p>

$$\{5, 6\} \quad \{6, 7, 8, 9\}$$

    <p>
    decided to share the item \(6\).
