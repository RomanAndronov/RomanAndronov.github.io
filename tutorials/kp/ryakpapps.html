    6.1) Maxwell-Boltzmann<br>
    6.2) Bose-Einstein<br>
    6.3) Fermi-Dirac<br>
    6.4) From Here<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    The combinatorial constructs that we have looked at so far are used in physics
    in <dfn>Statistical Mechanics</dfn> - a discipline that studies the behavior
    of systems comprised of a large number of weakly interacting particles in
    thermal equilibrium. The three major nonrelativistic \((v \ll c)\) statistics
    of this discipline are Maxwell-Boltzmann (classical), Bose-Einstein and
    Fermi-Dirac (quantum).
    </p>

    <p>
    In all three statistics the role of items is played by the idealized particles
    and the role of buckets is played by the amount of energy these particles
    possess. The energy levels are taken to always be distinct while the particles
    may or may not be distinct. To understand what <dfn>"distinct particle"</dfn>
    means in this section we have to take a very narrow and specific view of
    distinction contextualized by the applicability of statistical arguments and
    inference.
    </p>

    <p>
    All three statistics aspire to answer the following question:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>if some particle is selected at random what is the probability that it
    will have a specific (allowed) amount of energy?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    While calculating that probability we have to count the number of all of the
    possible intra- and interbucket distributions of the particles given certain
    statistics-specific constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
    Particles can be told apart via their intrinsic attributes like mass, charge
    and spin or somehow else. For statistical arguments and inference to be
    meaningful the number of participating items should be huge and the items
    themselves should be of the same type. As such the particles in this section
    are not discerned via their intrinsic attributes since these are the same.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>6.1) Maxwell-Boltzmann</strong>
    </p>

    </p>
    In Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics the particles (gas molecules) are classical.
    As such, they possess a fundamental property called <dfn>trajectory</dfn> -
    a smooth curve, \(\vec r(t)\) in general, representable as a real valued
    function of real argument that has at least two derivatives - the first
    (velocity) and the second (acceleration). We (hope that we can) solve the
    equations of Newton/Lagrange/Hamilton to find these functions.
    </p>

    <p>
    As such, even if we have two particles with identical intrinsic attributes,
    say two soccer/golf/billiard/etc. balls, we currently believe that two
    phenomena hold:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) a given point in space can be occupied by only one particle at any given
    time and conversely - one particle can be in only one place at any given time
    </p>

    <p>
    2) given a particle's trajectory if we caught that particle in one point in
    space at one time we can - for all practical purposes - with absolute
    certainty predict where that particle will be at all future times. The
    classical particles then are taken to be <dfn>distinct</dfn> in that sense
    - we can number and track them through space over time as described above.
    </p>

    <p>
    It follows then that in MB-statistics we are dealing with the distributions
    of distinct items among distinct buckets. Here multiple particles are allowed
    to have the same energy level - be in the same bucket. As such, to find the
    number of all the possible distributions of items in these systems we use
    (2) from <strong>5.1.2</strong> (permutations of a multiset with finite
    supply), to count the number of states <dfn>across</dfn> the buckets, and
    we use (1) from <strong>5.1.1</strong> (permutations of a multiset with
    infinite supply), to count the number of states <dfn>within</dfn> a single
    bucket. In other words we combine:
    </p>

$$P(n, r_1, \dots , r_k)$$

   <p>
   and:
   </p>

$$n^r$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>6.2) Bose-Einstein</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In quantum mechanics, however, it is currently held that its particles,
    electrons for short, do not possess a meaningful trajectory. If, in tiny
    volume of space, we were to record some number of coordinates of an
    electron as \(\Delta x\) over time intervals \(\Delta t\) then, in general,
    these can not be laid over a smooth curve as above. In fact, the more
    precise these measurements get the more haphazard the values of \(\Delta x\)
    become. Further, the classic definition of a derivative as a tangent also
    falls apart - if, while keeping the precision constant, we were to tend
    \(\Delta t\) to zero then the ratios:
    </p>

$$\frac {\Delta x}{\Delta t}$$

    <p>
    would <dfn>not</dfn> fall on a straight line.
    </p>

    <p>
    In 1927 Heisenberg captured this observation in his <dfn>Uncertainty
    Principle</dfn> which gives a numeric estimate for the boundaries between
    classical and wave mechanics - if we are very certain about <dfn>"where"</dfn>
    then we are just as uncertain about <dfn>"how fast"</dfn> and vice versa:
    </p>

$$\Delta x \times m \Delta v \gtrapprox  h$$

    <p>
    where:
    </p>

$$h = 6,63 \times 10^{-34} J \times s$$

    <p>
    (give or take) is Planck's Constant.
    </p>

    <p>
    This principle tells us that <dfn>simultaneously</dfn> position and velocity
    of an electron can not be measured with equal meaningful precision and no
    improvement of measuring devices can cure this limitation because it is so
    fundamental. <dfn>Separately</dfn> it is possible measure any one of these
    attributes with an arbitrary precision - but not both at the same time. So,
    within the above boundaries, if we happen to spot an electron in one location
    in space at one moment in time then we have no hope of figuring out with
    absolute certainty where will it appear next.
    </p>

    <p>
    In Quantum Mechanics then a <dfn>wave function</dfn> - a complex function of
    position and time - describes the state of a particle. That description is
    full and irreducible. Full - meaning that it packs absolutely everything there
    is to know about this particle. Irreducible - means that "within" the wave
    function the particle can not be made any smaller. We (hope that we can) solve
    Shrodinger's wave equation to find the particle's wave function.
    </p>

    <p>
    The physical interpretation of a wave function is quite lengthy but its
    mathematical counterpart, due to Born, is short - it is a probability amplitude.
    Its complex conjugate times the wave function itself is the probability density.
    The probability density times an infinitesmal volume of space is the
    <dfn>probability of finding a particle in that volume of space</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is a profoundly disturbing news for many - even if we know absolutely
    everything about a particle (its wave function) that the <dfn>theory</dfn>
    has to offer - the best we can do is come up short of determinacy of physical
    reality. In any case, given the above statistical constraints, the particles
    of the same type in wave mechanics are taken to be <dfn>indistinguishable</dfn>
    in the sense described above.
    </p>

    <p>
    (The Uncertainty Principle was formulated by Heisenberg in 1927 -
    <dfn>after</dfn> he and Shrodinger developed the mathematical apparatus of
    wave mechanics in 1925-1926. Separately, do not get confused by the relativity
    of scales in the above definitions - an electron may very well be treated as
    a classical particle under certain conditions - in Wilson's cloud chamber,
    for example. Separately again, two quantum particles of the same type can be
    made distinct enough - if they are in isolation and are so far apart from
    each other that their wave functions do not "overlap" or do not interfere
    with each other)
    </p>

    <p>
    In Bose-Einstein statistics multiple particles (photons, atomic nuclei, atoms
    with an even number of elementary particles or, collectively, bosons) are
    allowed to have the same energy level - be in the same bucket. Since these
    particles are indistinguishable, what matters is not what <dfn>kind</dfn> of
    particles are in any given bucket but rather <dfn>how many</dfn> of them are
    in it. The number of possible arrangements of this type is given by (3) in
    <strong>5.2.1</strong> (combinations of a multiset with infinite supply):
    </p>

$$\frac {(n + r - 1)!}{r! (n - 1)!}$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>6.3) Fermi-Dirac</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In Fermi-Dirac statistics multiple particles (electrons, neutrons, protons
    or, collectively, fermions) are <dfn>not</dfn> allowed to occupy the same
    energy level. Here any given bucket can have no more than one particle. This
    is known as the <dfn>Pauli Restriction</dfn> or <dfn>Pauli Exclusion</dfn>.
    As such at any given time the bucket is either empty or contains exactly one
    particle. It follows then that in this case the number of possible
    distributions is equal to the number of ways in which it is possible to
    distribute \(r\) indistinguishable items among \(n\) distinct buckets given
    the <strong>4.2.3.1-4.2.3.3</strong> restrictions or:
    </p>

$$C(n, r)$$

    <p>
    or (3) from <strong>4.2.1</strong>, combinations of a set.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since in all three statistics the resulting numbers contain a factorial of
    the total number of particles, that factorial will normally be enormous. And
    if the factorial is enormous then its Sterling's approximation works well -
    that is how in broad strokes (overlooking some number of gory details) the
    relevant formulas are deduced.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>6.4) From Here</strong>

    <p>
    Besides the combinatorial basics this tutorial should also put the reader on
    good footing with discrete probabilities since a large number of problems in
    that discipline are thinly disguised counting problems.
    </p>

    <p>
    Further beyond the horizon are sets in more depth, recurrence relations,
    generating functions, permutations and combinations generating algorithms,
    Bi/Multi/Nomial coefficients, special counting sequences, combinatorial designs,
    graphs and Polya counting.
