    3.1) Addition<br>
    3.2) Inclusion Exclusion<br>
    3.3) Multiplication<br>
    3.4) Subtraction<br>
    3.5) Division<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    The five basic counting principles are based on the ideas of growth and
    reduction. The <strong>Addition</strong>, <strong>Inclusion Exclusion</strong>,
    and <strong>Multiplication Counting Principles</strong> cover growth while
    the <strong>Subtraction</strong> and <strong>Division Counting
    Principles</strong> cover reduction.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before we deep dive into counting principles let us stop and ponder - exactly
    what Combinatorial Analysis <dfn>is</dfn>? In other words <dfn>why</dfn> do
    we need these counting principles in the first place? In very very broad
    strokes, at the introductory level, Combinatorial Analysis is a discipline
    that studies arrangements of a finite number of discrete items with the goal
    of answering the following questions:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) Is it even possible to construct the given arrangements?
    </p>

    <p>
    2) If so then what is their <dfn>number</dfn> and what <dfn>are</dfn> they
    (list them all)?
    </p>

    <p>
    3) What are their properties?
    </p>

    <p>
    4) Is it possible to optimize them - come up with the "best" arrangement?
    </p>

    <p>
    In this tutorial we will automatically assume that the answer to the first
    question is always "yes". We will ignore the questions three and four. We
    will mostly look at the first part of the second question - how many given
    arrangements are possible and that is where the basic counting principles
    enter the picture - they help us count. At one extreme we may even compress
    this entire tutorial into just one word - count!
    </p>

    <p>
    We will quickly discover that while the combinatorial formulas are good at
    producing the <dfn>number</dfn> of possible arrangements, they leave us in
    the dark when it comes to generating an <dfn>exhaustive list</dfn> of these
    arrangements.
    </p>

    <p>
    We may even draw a parallel here with the <dfn>Method of Mathematical
    Induction</dfn> which can be used to prove some formula but does not reveal
    the path to discovery of where did the formula come from to begin with.
    </p>

    <p>
    We can also find a similarity with the <dfn>Pigeonhole Principle</dfn> - it
    tells us that at least one bucket must contain more than one item but it does
    not reveal - exactly which bucket is it and exactly how many items are in it?
    </p>

    <p>
    In any case, while deducing the formulas we will, here and there, do the
    unthinkable - generate the arrangements on paper by hand. There are efficient,
    machine-ready algorithms to do just that - but you can study those on your
    own.
    </p>

    <p>
    Where appropriate we will formulate a principle in simple everyday terms and
    in a formal way using the sets notation. If we treat each possible arrangement
    that satisfies the requirements of a given problem as a subset - an item of
    a larger set then we can formalize the answer to the question "how many?" in
    terms of the size of that larger set.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>3.1) Addition Counting Principle (ACP)</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Simply:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>if an item can be selected from one collection in \(m\) ways and an item
    can be selected from a different collection in \(n\) ways then one item can
    be selected from either collection in \(m + n\) ways</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>ACP</strong> can be generalized for any finite number of collections.
    Formally verbally:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>the number of items in a union of pairwise disjoint sets is the sum of
    the number of items in each of the sets</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Formally symbolically:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>if a set \(S\) is partitioned into a finite number of \(n\) subsets
    \(S_1, S_2, \dots , S_n\) disjoint pairwise then the total number of items
    in \(S\) is equal to the sum of item counts in each subset
    \(S_j, j = 1, 2, \dots , n\):</dfn>
    </p>

$$|S| = \Big|\bigcup_{j=1}^n S_j \Big| = |S_1| + |S_2| + \dots + |S_n| =
 \sum_{j=1}^n |S_j|$$

    <p>
    The "disjoint pairwise" requirement is formalized as above and is of paramount
    importance - if it is not met then <strong>ACP</strong> does not apply and a
    similar but different and more generic - <strong>Inclusion Exclusion Counting
    Principle</strong> must be used.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Example E1</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>A bookcase contains \(1\) book on math, \(1\) on physics and \(1\)
    on computer science. How many books are in this bookcase or, equivalently,
    in how many different ways can we choose which book to read first?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Break the whole (bookcase) into \(n = 3\) sets \(M\) for Math, \(P\) for
    Physics, and \(C\) for compsci:
    </p>

$$|M| = 1, \; |P| = 1, \; |C| = 1$$

    <p>
    Since all the sets are disjoint pairwise:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/kp03.png" alt="kp 03" class="center">

    <p>
    the answer is:
    </p>

$$n = |M| + |P| + |C| = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>3.2) Inclusion Exclusion Counting Principle (IECP)</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us assume that in <strong>E1</strong> there is also a book on the subject
    of <dfn>Equations of Mathematical Physics</dfn>. How many books are in the
    bookcase now?
    </p>

    <p>
    If we attempt to solve this problem in exactly the same way as above we will
    obtain the following. When counting the books on math we surely will count
    the book on <dfn>Equations of Mathematical Physics</dfn>. After all, the
    word <dfn>"Mathematical"</dfn> in the book's title obliges:
    </p>

$$|M| = 2$$

    <p>
    When counting the books on physics we surely will count the book on
    <dfn>Equations of Mathematical Physics</dfn>. After all, the word
    <dfn>"Physics"</dfn> in the book's title obliges:
    </p>

$$|P| = 2$$

    <p>
    Lastly:
    </p>

$$|C| = 1$$

    <p>
    If we apply <strong>ACP</strong> to this problem then we have:
    </p>

$$n = |M| + |P| + |C| = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5$$

    <p>
    However, if we count the books by hand, without any combinatorial principles,
    we are sure to come up with a number:

$$n = 4$$

    <p>
    What gives?
    </p>

    <p>
    Upon closer examination we realize that we have counted the book on
    <dfn>Equations of Mathematical Physics</dfn> twice! We are being too generous,
    too inclusive - we are <dfn>overcounting</dfn>. The reason for this
    overcounting is the fact that the sets \(M\) and \(P\) are not disjoint any
    more - their intersection is not an empty set. It follows then that to
    compensate for overcounting we must subtract or exclude the size of the
    intersection of \(M\) and \(P\) from the total:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/kp04.png" alt="kp 04" class="center">

    <p>
    For two sets then the Inclusion Exclusion Counting Principle, formulaically,
    states that:
    </p>

$$|S_1 \cup S_2| = |S_1| + |S_2| - |S_1 \cap S_2|$$

    <p>
    and the theoretical answer to the current problem then agrees with the fact:
    </p>

$$|M| + |P| - |M \cap P| = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3$$
$$n = 3 + |C| = 3 + 1 = 4$$

    <p>
    What if there is also a book on <dfn>Numerical Methods</dfn> in the bookcase?
    This book covers the methods, among others, of numerical estimates of
    non-cooperating integrals which do not have a closed form expression. Such
    a book surely is a book on math and a book on compsci also:
    </p>

$$|M| = 3, \; |P| = 2, \; |C| = 2$$
$$|M \cap C| = 1$$

    <p>
    or graphically:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/kp05.png" alt="kp 05" class="center">

    <p>
    and we hope that we obtain the symbolic form of <strong>IECP</strong> for
    three sets:
    </p>

$$n = |M| + |P| + |C| - |M \cap P| - |M \cap C| = 3 + 2 + 2 - 1 - 1 = 5$$

    <p>
    Or do we?
    </p>

    <p>
    What if there is also a book titled <dfn>"Physics on a Computer,
    Modelling"</dfn>. In this book we investigate the ways to write a software
    program to trace a trajectory of a point mass thrown under an angle to a
    horizon with a certain initial velocity. Such a book then belongs to \(P\)
    and \(C\):
    </p>

$$|M| = 3, \; |P| = 3, \; |C| = 3$$
$$|P \cap C| = 1$$

    <p>
    or graphically:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/kp06.png" alt="kp 06" class="center">

    <p>
    and now we are done with <strong>IECP</strong> for three sets:
    </p>

$$n = |M| + |P| + |C| - |M \cap P| - |M \cap C| - |P \cap C| =$$
$$3 + 3 + 3 - 1 - 1 - 1 = 6$$

    <p>
    Or are we?
    </p>

    <p>
    What if there is also a book on <dfn>Computational Physics</dfn>? Such a book
    must belong to all three sets:
    </p>

$$|M| = 4, \; |P| = 4, \; |C| = 4$$
$$|M \cap P| = 2, \; |P \cap C| = 2, \; |M \cap C| = 2$$
$$|M \cap P \cap C| = 1$$

    <p>
    or graphically:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/kp07.png" alt="kp 07" class="center">

    <p>
    Are we done now?
    </p>

$$n_t = |M| + |P| + |C| - |M \cap P| - |M \cap C| - |P \cap C| -
 |M \cap P \cap C| =$$
$$4 + 4 + 4 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 1= 5$$

    <p>
    Hm. What is wrong? Surely there must be:
    </p>

$$n_p = 7$$

    <p>
    books in the bookcase now. We have started with \(3\) books in
    <strong>E1</strong> and added just four books:
    </p>

$$n_p = 3 + 4 = 7 \neq 5 = n_t$$

    <p>
    Out theoretical result, \(n_t\), does not agree with its practical
    counterpart, \(n_p\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Upon closer examination we observe that just like in our initial \(4-\)book
    attempt we have committed a counting crime. Only this time instead of
    overcounting we have <dfn>undercounted</dfn> something. To figure out what
    is going on here we consider the item that belongs to all three sets at once.
    </p>

    <p>
    We observe that at first, by including that common item in the total size of
    each set, we have counted it:
    </p>

$$1 + 1 + 1 = 1 \times 3 = 3$$

    <p>
    times.
    </p>

    <p>
    During the subtraction, however, we have excluded that common item once for
    each of the three pairs of intersections or:
    </p>

$$-1 -1 -1 = -1 \times 3 = -3$$

    <p>
    times.
    </p>

    <p>
    Between these two phases of counting we wound up not counting the item common
    to all three sets at all:
    </p>

$$3 - 3 = 0$$

    <p>
    And, to add an insult to an injury, we then subtracted the size of the
    intersection common to all three sets from the total. That was our mistake.
    </p>

    <p>
    It follows then that for three sets <strong>IECP</strong> has the following
    symbolic form:
    </p>

$$n = |M| + |P| + |C| - |M \cap P| - |P \cap C| - |M \cap C| +
 |M \cap P \cap C| =$$
$$4 + 4 + 4 - 2 - 2 - 2 + 1 = 7$$

    <p>
    We now put forward a hypothesis that for an arbitrary finite number of sets
    the following pattern always holds:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>we overcount the items in the intersections of an even number of sets
    while undercounting the items in the intersections of an odd number of
    sets</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Consider four sets, for example. Recalling our procedure to make
    indistinguishable items unique (section <strong>2.4</strong>) let us number
    the sets or circles in a clockwise fashion:
    </p>

$$1, 2, 3, 4$$

    <p>
    To make each item, \(1\), unique we assign to it a subscript which we
    construct as a list of all the circles that this particular item belongs
    to:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/kp08.png" alt="kp 08" class="center">

    <p>
    You are encouraged to go though the following exercise for other items while
    we shall look at the item common to all four sets:
    </p>

$$1_{1,2,3,4}$$

    <p>
    We will count that item four times as part of the overall size of each of
    four sets:
    </p>

$$1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 \times 4 = 4$$

    <p>
    Next we will count it four times for each of four intersections of pairs of
    sets comprised of immediate neighbors in the drawing:
    </p>

$$S_1 \cap S_2$$
$$S_2 \cap S_3$$
$$S_3 \cap S_4$$
$$S_4 \cap S_1$$

    <p>
    And then we will count it twice for each one of two intersection of pairs of
    sets comprised of "diagonal" neighbors in the drawing:
    </p>

$$S_1 \cap S_3$$
$$S_2 \cap S_4$$

    <p>
    Since we subtract the last two numbers from the running total, for the item
    \(1_{1,2,3,4}\) we have:
    </p>

$$4 - 4 - 2 = -2$$

    <p>
    Lastly, we will count that item four more times - once for each intersection
    of three sets:
    </p>

$$S_1 \cap S_2 \cap S_3$$
$$S_2 \cap S_3 \cap S_4$$
$$S_3 \cap S_4 \cap S_1$$
$$S_4 \cap S_1 \cap S_2$$

    <p>
    bringing the running total to:
    </p>

$$-2 + 4 = 2$$

    <p>
    To compensate for this overcounting we have to subtract the size of the above
    \(4-\)intersection from the total.
    </p>

    <p>
    We now see that to compute the size of a union of an arbitrary finite number
    of sets we:
    </p>

    <p>
    - include the size of each set
    </p>

    <p>
    - exclude the size of \(2-\)intersections
    </p>

    <p>
    - include the size of \(3-\)intersections
    </p>

    <p>
    - and so on until the \(n-\)intersection is reached. If \(n\) is even then
    exclude and if \(n\) is odd then include the size of the corresponding
    intersection:
    </p>

$$\Big|\bigcup_{i=1}^n S_i \Big| = \sum_{i=1}^n |S_i| -
 \sum_{1 \leqslant i < j \leqslant n} |S_i \cap S_j| +
 \sum_{1 \leqslant i < j < k \leqslant n} |S_i \cap S_j \cap S_k| -
 \dots + (-1)^{n-1}|S_1 \cap \dots \cap S_n|$$

    <p>
    or, more compactly, according to <strong>IECP</strong>:
    </p>

$$\Big|\bigcup_{i=1}^n S_i \Big| = \sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^{i+1}
 \sum_{1 \leqslant j_1 < \dots < j_i \leqslant n}
 |S_{j_1} \cap \dots \cap S_{j_i}|$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>3.3) Multiplication Counting Principle (MCP)</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    This principle is a consequence of <strong>ACP</strong> since for integers
    repetitive addition is multiplication.
    </p>

    <p>
    Simply for two events:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>if the first event has \(m\) outcomes and, regardless of the outcome of
    the first event, the second event has \(n\) outcomes then both events occurring
    in that sequence have a total of \(m \times n\) outcomes</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Formally verbally:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>the number of items in a union of \(m\) pairwise disjoint sets each of
    which has \(n\) items is \(m \times n\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Formally symbolically for two sets:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>let \(S_1\) be a set of items \(a_j, j = 1, \dots , |S_1| = m\) and let
    \(S_2\) be a set of items \(b_k, k = 1, \dots , |S_2| = n\). Assume that for
    each choice of item \(a_j\) from \(S_1\) there are \(n\) choices of items
    \(b_k\) from \(S_2\). If \(S\) is a set of ordered pairs \((a_j, b_k)\) then
    the number of items in \(S\) is \(m \times n\):</dfn>
    </p>

$$|S| = |S_1| \times |S_2| = m \times n$$

    <p>
    An ordered pair of items \((a, b)\) is a formation (collection) of two items
    whose order is specified. Obviously in this case order matters. We can use
    the same aggregate comparison procedure to compare two ordered pairs so
    technically \((a, b)\) and \((b, a)\) are different. Further, from the
    perspective of wholesome comparison, meaning <dfn>"as wholesome items"</dfn>,
    these two ordered pairs are different:
    </p>

$$(a_1, b_1) \neq (a_1, b_2)$$
 
    <p>
    Recall our earlier aggregate comparison discussion - even though the sizes
    of the above collections are the same their content is different.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now instead of viewing \(S\) as a set of ordered pairs let us partition it
    into some number of pairwise disjoint subsets whose items are still ordered
    pairs but these pairs are constructed in such a way that \(a_j\) in each
    pair is always placed first while the choices for \(b_k\) run their natural
    course:
    </p>

$$S_j = \{(a_j, b_1), (a_j, b_2), \dots , (a_j, b_n)\}$$

    <p>
    Since in the above pairs the choice of \(a_j\) remains fixed for any pair,
    it follows that the number of such pairs, or items in a subset, will be equal
    to the number of choices for \(b_k\) of which there are \(n\) in total:
    </p>

$$|S_j| = n$$

    <p>
    How many of these types of subsets will there be? Since the only item that
    will change from subset to subset is \(a_j\), it follows that the total number
    of these types of subsets must be equal to the number of choices for \(a_j\)
    of which there \(m\) in total.
    </p>

    <p>
    We can now apply <strong>ACP</strong> to all the subsets \(S_j\) where \(j\)
    runs from \(1\) to \(m\):
    </p>

$$|S| = \sum_{j=1}^m |S_j| = \underbrace{n + n + \dots + n}_{m} = m \times n$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Example E2</strong>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>In a library there are several large bays - floor sections filled with
    some number of bookcases. Preparing the library's quick reference guide for
    the incoming students, we want to label each bay with a capital letter
    followed by one digit. We settle on the letters \(A, B, C, D\) and digits
    \(1, 2, 3\). How many bays can be uniquely labeled?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    In this case we have:
    </p>

$$S_1 = \{A, B, C, D\}$$
$$S_2 = \{1, 2, 3\}$$

    <p>
    We observe that for each current choice of a letter - regardless of the
    previously made choices - there are \(|S_2| = 3\) choices for a digit. The
    choices for \(A\) are:
    </p>

$$\{(A, 1), (A, 2), (A, 3)\}$$

    <p>
    The choices for \(B\) are:
    </p>

$$\{(B, 1), (B, 2), (B, 3)\}$$

    <p>
    and so on. We can now construct our set \(S\) of ordered pairs \((a_j, b_k)\):
    </p>

$$S = \{\{A1, A2, A3\}, \{B1, B2, B3\}, \{C1, C2, C3\}, \{D1, D2, D3\}\}$$

    <p>
    where we have partitioned \(S\) into pairwise disjoint subsets and skipped
    the parenthesis for ordered pairs. Based on <strong>MCP</strong> we reason
    that we can label:
    </p>

$$|S| = |S_1| \times |S_2| = 4 \times 3 = 12$$

    <p>
    bays.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note here that for demonstration purposes we may rearrange \(S\) in a form
    of a table - a two-dimensional matrix - whose rows are driven by letters and
    whose columns are driven by digits:
    </p>

$$A1 A2 A3$$
$$B1 B2 B3$$
$$C1 C2 C3$$
$$D1 D2 D3$$

    <p>
    We have omitted all the delimiters here. We see that we have \(4 = |S_1|\)
    rows and \(3 = |S_2|\) columns in the table for a total of \(12\) ordered
    pairs.
    </p>

    <p>
    Recall that for <strong>ACP</strong> to be applicable the "pairwise disjoint"
    requirement must stand. For <strong>MCP</strong> to be applicable the
    "independence" requirement must stand:
    </p>

    <p class="center">
    <dfn>the number of current choices can not depend on the previously made
    choices</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    The above requirement is of paramount importance for <strong>MCP</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    If during a solution of a problem we find ourselves saying "... number of
    choices of so and so depends on what was chosen before ..." then
    <strong>MCP</strong> is not applicable <dfn>in this particular chain of
    reasoning</dfn> - it may still be applicable in a given problem if it is
    possible to find a way to rejigger the situation so that the choices do
    become "independent", see <strong>E7</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the above matrix this independence requirement is packed into "for every
    letter there are \(m\) digits to choose from" requirement.
    </p>

    <p>
    Based on the above demonstration it is possible to rephrase
    <strong>MCP</strong> as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>if \(S_1\) is a set of items \(a_j, j = 1, \dots , |S_1| = m\) and
    \(S_2\) is a set of items \(b_k, k = 1, \dots , |S_2| = n\) then the number
    of ordered pairs \((a_j, b_k)\) that can be constructed with the items taken
    from each set is \(m \times n\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    We will mention in passing here that the above set formed by the ordered
    pairs \((a_j, b_k)\) is called a <dfn>Cartesian Product</dfn> of \(S_1\)
    and \(S_2\).

    <p>
    We can now extend <strong>MCP</strong> to an arbitrary finite number of
    events/sets.
    </p>

    <p>
    Simply:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>if in a sequence of \(k\) events the number of outcomes \(m_j\) of the
    \(j-\)th event does not depend on the outcomes of the previous \(j - 1\) events
    (for all the events) then the number of outcomes of the entire sequence of
    events is equal to the product of the numbers of the individual outcomes of
    all the events in the sequence:</dfn>
    </p>

$$m_1 \times m_2 \times \dots \times m_k$$

    <p>
    Just as we formed ordered pairs \((a, b)\), we can form ordered
    \(n-\)tuples where \(n\) items are arranged in a specified order: \((a, b,
    c, \dots \)).
    </p>

    <p>
    Formally:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>let \(C\) be an ordered collection of \(k\) sets \(S_j, j = 1, 2, \dots ,
    n\) such that \(|S_j| = m_j\). Assume that for each item from \(S_j\) there
    are \(m_{j+1}\) choices of the items from \(S_{j+1}\) (for all the subsets).
    If \(S\) is a set of ordered \(n-\)tuples formed by the items from each
    \(S_j\) from \(C\) then the number of items in \(S\) is \(m_1 \times m_2
    \times \dots \times m_n\):</dfn>
    </p>

$$|S| = |S_1| \times |S_2| \times \dots \times |S_n| = \prod_{j=1}^n|S_j|$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Workout</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    To help make the above passage less abstract think of a concrete example of
    it and generate all the ordered \(n-\)tuples by hand:
    </p>

$$C = \{S_1, S_2, S_3 \}, \; |C| = 3$$
$$S_1 = \{a, b, c, d \}, \; |S_1| = 4$$
$$S_2 = \{1, 2, 3 \}, \; |S_2| = 3$$
$$S_3 = \{!, ? \}, \; |S_3| = 2$$

    <p>
    Interpreting the above principle literally, to construct a \(3-\)tuple we
    choose the first item from \(S_1\):
    </p>

$$(a)$$

    <p>
    for which we have \(|S_2| = 3\) choices of \(S_2\) items for each of which
    we have \(|S_3| = 2\) choices of \(S_3\) items:
    </p>

$$(a, 1, !)$$
$$(a, 1, ?)$$

    <p>
    Then:
    </p>

$$(a, 2, !)$$
$$(a, 2, ?)$$

    <p>
    Next:
    </p>

$$(a, 3, !)$$
$$(a, 3, ?)$$

    <p>
    And so on. Write down all \(24\) ordered \(3-\)tuples.

    Since in a qualifying number the tens digit can not be zero, there are \(9\)

    Whatever non-zero digit we choose for tens - we can not choose it for units.

    <p>
    It may sound trivial but do observe here that the <dfn>contents</dfn> of the

$$9 \times 8 = 72$$

    as a unit.

    <p>
    Let us now bring to light the reason why <strong>MCP</strong> deals with the
    <dfn>ordered</dfn> formations - ordered pairs, ordered n-tuples, and why the
    independence requirement is so important.
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>How many odd numbers between \(1,000\) and \(9,999\) have distinct
    digits?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    For the above type of number to be odd we have the following choices for the
    <strong>TH</strong>ousands, <strong>H</strong>undreds, <strong>T</strong>ens
    and <strong>U</strong>nits sets:
    </p>

$$TH = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}, \; |TH| = 9$$
$$H = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}, \; |H| = 10$$
$$T = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}, \; |T| = 10$$
$$U = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}, \; |U| = 5$$

    <p>
    We start solving this problem in the same order we did it in the previous one.
    For \(TH\) we have \(9\) choices. For \(H\) then there are \(9\) choices
    regardless of the previous choice and for \(T\) there are \(8\) choices
    regardless of the previous two choices made.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, the number of choices for the units is in deep trouble - if we chose
    an even digit prior then there are \(5\) choices for unit items and if we
    chose an odd digit prior then there are \(4\) choices for units. The number
    of choices for units "depends" - <strong>MCP</strong> does not apply and the
    ordered \(4-\)tuple \((TH, H, T, U)\) is not a good choice.

    <p>
    What if instead we turn it around and form an ordered \((U, T, H, TH)\)
    \(4-\)tuple?
    </p>

    <p>
    We then have \(5\) choices for units. Whatever that digit is - it is in \(T\),
    we can eliminate it and so there are \(10 - 1 = 9\) choices for tens regardless.
    </p>

    <p>
    By the same logic, regardless of the previous two choices, there are now
    \(10 - 2 = 8\) choices for hundreds. But the number of choices for thousands
    is now in deep trouble - if we ever chose zero prior then, since zero is not
    in \(TH\) then it can not be eliminated and the number of choices we have for
    \(TH\) is \(9\). If we never chose zero prior then that digit can be
    eliminated from \(TH\) which now has \(8\) choices. The independence
    requirement is not met, <strong>MCP</strong> does not apply.
    </p>

    <p>
    Is there any hope? A lesson to learn from this is that sometimes failures
    are not that bad. If we somehow are sure that a solution does exist (a tricky
    bit) then each failure tells us what not to try the next time and it brings
    us one step closer to a solution.
    </p>

    <p>
    After the first failure we decided to deal with (odd) units first. The second
    failure tells us that zeros in \(T\) and \(H\) are the source of grief. What
    if we deal with them last and form an ordered \(4-\)tuple \((U, TH, H, T)\)?
    </p>

    <p>
    We then have \(5\) choices for units. Regardless of the previous choice there
    are now \(9 - 1 = 8\) choices for thousands. Regardless of the previous two
    choices - some two distinct digits each of which is in \(H\) and can be
    eliminated - there are now \(10 - 2 = 8\) choices for hundreds. Regardless
    of the previous three choices - some three distinct digits one of which may
    be zero and each of which can be eliminated from \(T\) - there are \(10 - 3
    = 7\) choices for tens.
    </p>

    <p>
    After giving the ordered \(4-\)tuple and the independence requirement a
    thorough workout we feel confident that the answer is:
    </p>

$$5 \times 8 \times 8 \times 7 = 2,240$$

    <br><strong>3.4) Subtraction Counting Principle (SCP)</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Let \(U\) be a set containing a subset \(A\):
    </p>

$$U = \{1, 2, 3, \{4, 5, 6\}, 7, 8, 9\}$$
$$A = \{4, 5, 6\}$$

    <p>
    We define a <dfn>complement</dfn> of \(A\) in \(U\), denoted as:
    </p>

$$U \; \backslash \; A$$

    <p>
    as a set comprised of all the items from \(U\) that are not in \(A\):
    </p>

$$U \; \backslash \; A = \{1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9\}$$

    <p>
    As a shorthand notation a complement set is sometimes denoted as:
    </p>

$$\bar A, \; A', \; A^c$$

    <p>
    If \(U\) is a set of "all the items" - whatever that means - it is sometimes
    called a <dfn>universal set</dfn> and the corresponding complement is then
    called <dfn>absolute</dfn>. If \(U\) is some generic set, not a universal
    set of all items, name it \(B\) to avoid confusion, then the complement is
    sometimes called <dfn>relative</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    By Subtraction Counting Principle:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>the number of items in the original set \(A\) is equal to the difference
    between the number of items in the larger set \(U\) and in the \(A\)'s
    complement set in \(U\) \(A^c\):</dfn>
    </p>

$$|A| = |U| - |A^c|$$

    <p>
    The idea may seem trivial but it has some profound consequences. We will
    discuss some of them later but to prepare the ground a little bit just think
    about it - whatever items are in \(A^c\) they are not in \(A\) and conversely.
    As such, a subset \(A\) of \(U\) is uniquely defined by the \(|A^c|\) items
    that are not in \(A\) and conversely.
    </p>

    <p>
    The reason <strong>SCP</strong> comes in handy is because sometimes it is
    easier to compute the size of the complement set than the size of the original
    set. For demonstration purposes let us do
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Example E8</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    by solving <strong>E6</strong> using <strong>SCP</strong>. We already know
    that:
    </p>

$$|U| = 90$$

    <p>
    and we know that it contains all the possible two-digit numbers without
    exception.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let \(A\) be a set of all the numbers in the second question: two-digit
    numbers with distinct digits. We can easily construct \(A\)'s complement
    in \(U\):
    </p>

$$A^c = \{ 11, 22, 33, \dots , 99\}, \; |A^c| = 9$$

    <p>
    By <strong>SCP</strong> we have:
    </p>

$$|A| = 90 - 9 = 81$$

    <p>
    For the third question we turn the above \(A\) into \(U\). We let a new \(A\)
    be a set of all the two-digit numbers with distinct and non-zero digits. Again,
    we can easily construct \(A\)'s complement in \(U\):
    </p>

$$A^c = \{ 10, 20, 30, \dots , 90 \}, \; |A^c| = 9$$

    <p>
    By <strong>SCP</strong> we have:
    </p>

$$|A| = 81 - 9 = 72$$

    <p>

    <dfn>There are \(5\) red and \(7\) green marbles. If we require that there
    should be no empty jars - there should be at least one marble in a jar - how
    many jars can be filled with different arrangements of these marbles?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    We observe that the marbles of the same color are indistinguishable. As such,
    the only thing that matters in their arrangement is the <dfn>number</dfn> of
    marbles of each color we put in a jar.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, if we decide to use <strong>MCP</strong> as is in an anticipation
    that the answer should be:
    </p>

$$5 \times 7 = 35$$

    <p>
    then its independence requirement will complain long and loud since the number
    of choices of the green marbles will be \(7\) or \(8\) - depending on whether
    we used any red marbles prior or not and conversely.
    </p>

    <p>
    To avoid this dependency we temporarily ignore the "no empty jar" requirement.
    Then the number of choices of the red marbles is always \(6\), including a
    choice when zero red marbles were used, and the number of choices of the green
    marbles is always \(8\), including a choice when zero green marbles were used.
    By <strong>MCP</strong> we can fill:
    </p>

$$6 \times 8 = 48$$

    <p>
    jars with different marble arrangements - including one empty jar. But an empty
    jar is a complement of the "non-empty jars" set in a set of "all jars" and by

    We partition the set of non-empty jars into two sets: \(G\) - with no red
    marbles and \(GR\) - with at least one red marble. Then:
    </p>

$$|G| = 7$$

    <p>
    The \(GR\) set we partition further in such a way that it has \(5\) subsets
    each of which has \(7 + 1 = 8\) items in it. The \("+ 1"\) here is for the
    "no green marbles" choice. Two sample subsets of this kind, for example, are:

$$S_1 = \{1R, 2R, 3R, 4R, 5R, 1R1G, 1R2G, 1R3G \}$$
$$S_2 = \{1R4G, 1R5G, 1R6G, 1R7G, 2R1G, 2R2G, 2R3G, 2R4G \}$$

    <p>
    where to conserve space we have used the repetition number in front of the
    letter representing each color, \(R\) is for read and \(G\) is for green.

    Yet another way to solve this problem is to partition all the marbles as

    \(G\) will contain only and all the green marbles:
    </p>

$$|R| = 5, \quad |G| = 7$$

    <p>
    The remaining set \(RG\) we partition similar to the way we partitioned the
    set of ordered pairs in <strong>MCP</strong>: in the current subset we always
    place the same non-zero number of red marbles first and let the choices for
    the green marbles run their course:
    </p>

$$S_1 = \{1R1G, 1R2G, 1R3G, 1R4G, 1R5G, 1R6G, 1R7G \}$$
$$S_2 = \{2R1G, 2R2G, 2R3G, 2R4G, 2R5G, 2R6G, 2R7G \}$$

    <p>
    By <strong>DCP</strong>:
    </p>

$$5 = \frac {|GR|}{7}$$
$$|GR| = 5 \times 7 = 35$$

    <p>
    and by <strong>ACP</strong> the answer to the problem is:
