    <br><strong>1) Prerequisites</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    To derive the most benefit from this tutorial the reader should feel comfortable
    with prime numbers, the building blocks of all <dfn>other</dfn> numbers, the
    Prime Factorization Theorem, or PFT, and the Division Algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
    Prime numbers, or just <dfn>primes</dfn>, are natural numbers strictly greater
    than \(1\) that have no positive divisors other than \(1\) and themselves. For
    example, the following numbers are all prime:
    </p>

$$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29$$

    <p>
    Numbers that are not prime are called composite numbers or just
    <dfn>composites</dfn>. We observe in passing that \(2\) is the only
    <dfn>even</dfn> prime; the number \(1\) is not a prime; the number of primes is
    infinite as was proven by Euclid via the <dfn>"product of all primes plus
    one"</dfn> argument (<dfn>"Elements"</dfn>, Book 9 Proposition 20).
    </p>

    <p>
    The Prime Factorization Theorem, or PFT for short, also known as Fundamental
    Theorem of Arithmetic, states that any natural number \(n > 1\) is either
    prime already or has a unique factorization over primes if the order of factors
    is ignored. For example, a composite number \(30\) has the following factorization
    over primes:
    </p>

$$30 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$$

    <p>
    Multiple like prime factors may either be kept expanded or collected under one
    power in which case the exponential notation is used to record this particular
    factorization:
    </p>

$$540 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5$$

    <p>
    The Division Algorithm states that for any two given integers \(n\) and \(d\),
    where \(d > 0\), there exist unique integers \(q\) and \(r\) such that:
    </p>

$$n = qd + r, 0 \leqslant r < b$$

    <p>
    The integers \(n, d, q\) and \(r\) are called the <dfn>dividend</dfn>,
    <dfn>divisor</dfn>, <dfn>quotient</dfn> and <dfn>remainder</dfn> respectively.
    From now on, to eliminate the repetitive remarks, we will take it as given that
    any divisor under discussion is not equal to zero.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, for \(a = 38\) and \(b = 7\):
    </p>

$$38 = 5 \cdot 7 + 3, q = 5, r = 3$$

    <p>
    Do not overlook the facts that \(r\) is non-negative and strictly less than
    \(b\) as these facts are of importance.
    </p>
 
    <p>
    <br><strong>2) Initial Observations</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In this tutorial we will concentrate on the intuitive side of the material -
    the one that is frequently omitted from the textbooks. It should be remembered,
    however, that the sole reliance on intuition in mathematics may lead to
    mistakes - the harsh reality of formalism must be faced sooner or later.
    <p>

    We have skimmed through or possibly even read the Euclidean GCD-computing
    Algorithm with a reasonable degree of attention and effort but it all seems
    clear as mud. All these subscripts and all these repetitive steps look
    incomprehensible.
    </p>

    <p>
    When we come across a poorly understood or confusing material we have only two
    choices - walk away or persevere. If we choose to persevere then we need some
    sort of strategy to attack the problem. What follows is just <dfn>a way</dfn>,
    not a template, to attempt to untangle a (seemingly) messy issue.
    </p>

    <p>
    Our angle of attack: create our own empirical evidence - concrete examples,
    using data that we understand. If we feel comfortable with numbers and their
    manipulations then chances are high that we will succeed in figuring out what
    really is going on.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since the algorithm in question is dealing with division and subtraction, do we
    really understand what <dfn>a divisor</dfn> is? By definition, an integer \(a\)
    is (evenly) divisible by an integer \(b \neq 0\), in symbols: \(b | a\), meaning
    \(b\) divides \(a\), if there exists some integer \(n\) such that:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
a = n \cdot b
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    We observe that the above is just a convenient specific case of the Division
    Algorithm when \(r = 0\). For example, \(3\) (evenly) divides \(30\):
    </p>

$$30 = 10 \cdot 3$$
$$a = 30, b = 3, n = 10$$

    <p>
    and, in a multitude of allowable ways, we would say that:
    </p>

    <p>
    - <dfn>\(b\) divides \(a\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    - <dfn>\(b\) is a divisor of \(a\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    - <dfn>\(b\) is a factor of \(a\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    - <dfn>\(a\) is a multiple of \(b\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    It follows then that if \(a\) is divisible by \(b\) then \(a\) is also divisible
    by \(-b\) which means that the divisors of an integer always come in pairs. To
    obtain all the divisors of a given integer it is enough to find all the positive
    ones and add to them thier negative equivalents. For this reason, without the loss
    of generality, we can safely limit ourselves to considering only positive divisors
    in particular and positive integers in general.
    </p>
 
    <p>
    Since our algorithm deals with a specific type of commonality between two numbers,
    how about a different number with the same, or common, or shared, factor of \(3\):
    </p>

$$21 = 3 \cdot 7$$

    <p>
    Now we start asking questions: if we add two such numbers together then what can
    be said about their common factor with respect to their sum? Let us see:
    </p>

$$30 + 21 = 3 \cdot 10 + 3 \cdot 7 = 3 \cdot (10 + 7)$$

    <p>
    Hm, we remember that integers are closed under addition - an arithmetic sum of
    a finite number of integers will always be an integer! Hence, we can rewrite the
    above as:
    </p>

$$30 + 21 = 51 = a = 3 \cdot b, b = 10 + 7$$

    <p>
    But the last equation looks exactly like (\(1\)) since:
    </p>

$$a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$$

    <p>
    Hence, we conclude that a common factor of two integers also divides their sum.
    This gives us the courage to switch from empirical and inductive to theoretical
    and deductive and conclude that for chosen integers \(a, b, f\):
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>if \(f | a\) and \(f | b\) then \(f | (a + b)\)
    </p>

    <p>
    Proof: if \(f | a\) then:
    </p>

$$a = f \cdot n_a$$

    <p>
    and if \(f | b\) then:
    </p>

$$b = f \cdot n_b$$

    <p>
    and hence:
    </p>

$$a + b = f \cdot n_a + f \cdot n_b = f \cdot (n_a + n_b)$$
$$(a + b) \in \mathbb{Z}$$
$$(n_a + n_b) \in \mathbb{Z}$$

    <p>
    \(\square\)
    </p>

    <p>
    In our concrete example we had \(f = 3, n_a = 10, n_b = 7\) and we can say that
    a common factor of two integers remains invariant under the operation of arithmetic
    summation of these integers.
    </p>

    <p>
    What about a difference of two integers?
    </p>

$$30 - 21 = 3 \cdot 10 - 3 \cdot 7 = 3 \cdot (10 - 7)$$

    <p>
    Here we recall that integers (not natural numbers, careful!) are closed under
    subtraction:
    </p>

$$30 - 21 = 9 = a = 3 \cdot b, b = 10 - 7$$
$$a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$$

    <p>
    and we conclude that a common factor of two integers also divides their difference.
    Switching from empirical and inductive to theoretical and deductive we obtain for
    chosen integers \(a, b, f\):
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>if \(f | a\) and \(f | b\) then \(f | (a - b)\)
    </p>

    <p>
    Proof: if \(f | a\) then:
    </p>

$$a = f \cdot n_a$$

    <p>
    and if \(f | b\) then:
    </p>

$$b = f \cdot n_b$$

    <p>
    and hence:
    </p>

$$a - b = f \cdot n_a - f \cdot n_b = f \cdot (n_a - n_b)$$
$$(a - b) \in \mathbb{Z}$$
$$(n_a - n_b) \in \mathbb{Z}$$

    <p>
    \(\square\)
    </p>

    <p>
    We can also say that a common factor of two integers is invariant under the
    operation of subtraction of these integers. For future reference let us name
    this the D-Theorem, for difference.
    </p>

    <p>
    Armed with success, we now get brave and ambitious and ask: what about an
    arbitrary linear combination of two integers?
    </p>

$$30 \cdot 4 + 21 \cdot 5 = 3 \cdot 10 \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 5 =
3 \cdot ( 10 \cdot 4 + 7 \cdot 5 )$$

    <p>
    Since integers are closed under multiplication also, it follows that the
    mathematical objects on both sides of the above equation are integers:
    </p>

$$(30 \cdot 4 + 21 \cdot 5) \in \mathbb{Z}$$
$$(10 \cdot 4 + 7 \cdot 5 ) \in \mathbb{Z}$$

    <p>
    We see that a common factor of two integers also divides their arbitrary linear
    combination or remains invariant with respect to the operation of constructing
    their arbitrary linear combination. For chosen integers \(a, b, f\):
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>if \(f | a\) and \(f | b\) then \(f | (ax + by)\) for any integers \(x\)
    and \(y\)
    </p>

    <p>
    Proof: if \(f | a\) then:
    </p>

$$a = f n_a$$

    <p>
    and if \(f | b\) then:
    </p>

$$b = f n_b$$

    <p>
    and hence, for any integers \(x\) and \(y\) we have:
    </p>

$$ax + by = f n_a x + f n_b y = f (n_a x + n_b y)$$
$$(a x + b y) \in \mathbb{Z}$$
$$(n_a x + n_b y) \in \mathbb{Z}$$

    <p>
    \(\square\)
    </p>

    <p>
    For later reference let us call the above - the LC-Theorem, for Linear Combination.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before we move on, let us get a good handle on exactly what a GCD, the subject
    of our computational search, is.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>3) GCD</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    A standard, textbook, definition of GCD is the following: it is a strictly
    positive number \(d\) that divides both integers \(a\) and \(b\), at least
    one of which is not zero, and if there exists any other common factor
    of \(a\) and \(b\) then that factor is not greater than \(d\). In symbols:
    \(d > 0\), \(d | a\) and \(d | b\) and if \(c | a\) and \(c | b\) then
    \(c \leqslant d\).

    <p>
    The reason we require that at least one of two integers is not zero is to avoid
    dealing with infinitude of potential divisors. If both integers are zero then,
    since any integer divides zero, the number of divisors of two such integers will
    be infinite. If, on the other hand, at least one integer is not zero then the
    number of common divisors becomes finite, we can sort these divisors in an ascending
    order and the last such divisor will be the greatest one. It follows then that:
    </p>

$$gcd(a, 0) = a$$

    <p>
    a fact used in the Euclidean GCD Algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is often the case in mathematics that a definition of an object provides no
    clues to its construction or computation. As such, the definition above is
    certainly one of those - it tells us what GCD <dfn>is</dfn> but gives no recipe
    for its <dfn>computation</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    One initially intuitive way to compute a GCD is as follows: factorize \(a\) over
    primes and put the resulting prime factors into a multiset \(A\). Factorize \(b\)
    over primes and put the corresponding prime factors into a multiset \(B\). Take
    the intersection of \(A\) and \(B\) and multiply through all the numbers in it.
    For example:
    </p>

$$a = 525 = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$$
$$A = \{3, 5, 5, 7\}$$
$$b = 60 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$$
$$B = \{2, 2, 3, 5\}$$
$$A \cap B = \{3, 5\}$$
$$gcd( 525, 60 ) = 3 \cdot 5 = 15$$

    <p>
    (recall that multisets are sets, or collections, of items where duplicates are
    allowed)
    </p>

    <p>
    If it so happens that the intersection of two multisets in question is empty then
    we take it that number \(1\) is the only common factor of two integers, in symbols:
    </p>

$$gcd(a, b) = 1$$

    <p>
    in which case the numbers are called <dfn>coprime</dfn> or relatively prime.
    Observe that two composites can very well be coprime:
    </p>

$$a = 77 = 7 \cdot 11$$
$$A = \{7, 11\}$$
$$b = 18 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3$$
$$B = \{2, 3, 3\}$$
$$A \cap B = \emptyset$$

    <p>
    The integers above do not share any common prime factors and hence:
    </p>

$$gcd(77, 18) = 1$$

    <p>
    Now that we have a way of computing a GCD of two integers, let us begin our
    investigation of the inner workings of the Euclidean GCD Algorithm with two
    integers that have some number of common prime factors.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>4) Some Commonality</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Our naive way of computing a GCD may work reasonably well when the integers are
    small and we can figure out their prime factors quickly. For large numbers, however,
    our algorithm becomes impractical quickly because prime factorization of such
    numbers takes too long. As such, we seek a faster way to compute a GCD of two
    integers and the Euclidean Algorithm is one answer.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since the algorithm in question deals with subtraction, let us construct the
    simplest possible differences of two integers, \(a = 525\) and \(b = 60\), by always
    subtracting a smaller number from a larger one. Why this is useful will become clear
    soon:
    </p>

$$\begin{array}{rcrcr}
525 & - & 60 & = & 465 \\
465 & - & 60 & = & 405 \\
405 & - & 60 & = & 345 \\
345 & - & 60 & = & 285 \\
285 & - & 60 & = & 225 \\
225 & - & 60 & = & 165 \\
165 & - & 60 & = & 105 \\
105 & - & 60 & = & 45 \\
\end{array}$$

    <p>
    If we were to blindly proceed at this stage then the next difference would become
    negative:
    </p>

$$45 - 60 = -15$$

    <p>
    and all the consequent differences would remain negative also - we know that \(\mathbb{Z}\)
    has neither upper nor lower bounds. For any finite positive integer we can always produce
    one larger and for any finite negative integer we can always produce one smaller. Hence,
    our process would go on forever and will never terminate. We, on the contrary, want to
    find a process that is guaranteed to terminate in a finite number of steps.
    </p>

    <p>
    In order to ensure that our procedure "converges" in such a fashion - terminates after a
    finite number of steps - let us perform the following substitutions:
    </p>

    <p>
    - promote the "old" integer \(b = 60\) to become a "new" integer \(a\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - promote the "old" difference (\(45\)) to become the "new" integer \(b\):
    </p>

$$a = 60, b = 45$$
$$60 - 45 = 15$$

    <p>
    We see that the new integer \(b = 45\) is greater than the difference, \(15\), so
    we perform the same substitutions (promotions) again:
    </p>

$$a = 45, b = 15$$
$$45 - 15 = 30$$

    <p>
    We see that this time the difference, \(30\), is greater than current magnitude of
    \(b\), so we carry out the subtraction without any promotions:
    </p>

$$30 - 15 = 15$$

    <p>
    And finally:
    </p>

$$15 - 15 = 0$$

    <p>
    When the above difference becomes zero - our procedure terminates and, according
    to the Euclidean GCD Algorithm, the GCD in question is the last non-zero remainder:
    </p>

$$gcd(525,60)=15$$

    <p>
    We now ask the next question: did we just get lucky or, as long as we follow the
    above procedure, the difference will always become zero (after a finite number of
    steps)? We try more different cases and see that they all work. Why?
    </p>

    <p>
    One bright idea that may illuminate the situation is the following - let us
    factorize our differences over primes:
    </p>

$$\begin{array}{rcrcrcl}
525 & - & 60 & = & 465 & = & (3 \cdot 5) \cdot 31 \\
465 & - & 60 & = & 405 & = & 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot (3 \cdot 5) \\
405 & - & 60 & = & 345 & = & (3 \cdot 5) \cdot 23 \\
345 & - & 60 & = & 285 & = & (3 \cdot 5) \cdot 19 \\
285 & - & 60 & = & 225 & = & 3 \cdot (3 \cdot 5) \cdot 5 \\
225 & - & 60 & = & 165 & = & (3 \cdot 5) \cdot 11 \\
165 & - & 60 & = & 105 & = & (3 \cdot 5) \cdot 7 \\
105 & - & 60 & = & 45 & = & 3 \cdot (3 \cdot 5) \\
60 & - & 45 & = & 15 & = & (3 \cdot 5) \\
45 & - & 15 & = & 30 & = & 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 5) \\
30 & - & 15 & = & 15 & = & (3 \cdot 5) \\
15 & - & 15 & = & 0 \\
\end{array}$$

    <p>
    We now observe something quite remarkable: the GCD of two integers in question seems
    to travel through all the differences and survive them all! What is going on here?
    </p>

    <p>
    Intuitively we may reason as follows. Let us, for a moment, call a GCD a commonality
    between two given numbers. Recall that to even begin thinking about a GCD we must
    have at least two numbers - a GCD of a single integer makes no sense. So when we fix
    two integers, \(525\) and \(60\) for example, we automatically seal the fate of their
    commonality.
    </p>

    <p>
    To compute the amount of this commonality in one number with respect to the other,
    we can multiply all the prime factors of the integer that are not GCD - do realize
    that at this point we are assuming that we know what the GCD actually is:
    </p>

$$525 = (3 \cdot 5) \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 35 \cdot (3 \cdot 5)$$
$$60 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 5) = 4 \cdot (3 \cdot 5)$$

    <p>
    In this case there are \(35\) units of commonality in \(525\) with respect to
    \(60\) and there are \(4\) units of commonality in \(60\) with respect to \(525\).
    How do we extract the magnitude of that commonality assuming that we do not know
    it? By constructing and computing the consecutive differences.
    </p>

    <p>
    Recall that our first difference in the series:
    </p>

$$525 - 60 = 465 = (3 \cdot 5) \cdot 31$$

    <p>
    produced a smaller magnitude that had \(31\) units of commonality (with respect to both
    numbers \(a\) and \(b\)) and we now understand why. If we recall our D-Theorem that we
    proved earlier then it should be clear that even though the GCD is the largest common
    factor - it is still a common factor of two integers and the D-Theorem is applicable to
    it in equal measure. As such, we are guaranteed that the magnitude of the GCD in question
    is preserved in the above difference.
    </p>

    <p>
    The next difference produced a magnitude that had \(27\) units of commonality:
    </p>

$$465 - 60 = 405 = 27 \cdot (3 \cdot 5)$$

    <p>
    but the same logic is applicable to that difference as well and we are guaranteed that
    it also carries the magnitude of the GCD in question unmolested. And so on. Eventually
    we came to the difference that held less units of commonality between \(525\) and \(60\)
    than the smallest original or current integer \(b\):
    </p>

$$105 - 60 = 45 = 3 \cdot (3 \cdot 5) < 4 \cdot (3 \cdot 5) = 60$$

    <p>
    However, we see that regardless of the length of the chain of consecutive subtractions,
    the numbers \(60\) and \(45\) do possess the original commonality, the GCD in question,
    nonetheless. So all we need to do now is to ensure that we keep subtracting a smaller
    number from the larger one by switching the roles that the original numbers \(a = 525\)
    and \(b = 60\) played earlier and applying the same logic and process to the new
    \(a = 60\) and the new \(b = 45\):
    </p>

$$60 - 45 = 15 = 1 \cdot (3 \cdot 5)$$

    <p>
    We see that:
    </p>

$$15 = 1 \cdot (3 \cdot 5) < 3 \cdot (3 \cdot 5) = 45$$

    <p>
    so we substitute/promote/switch the numbers \(a\) and \(b\) again:
    </p>

$$a = 45, b = 15$$
$$45 - 15 = 30 = 2 \cdot (3 \cdot 5)$$

    <p>
    and again until we reach the difference that is exactly zero:
    </p>

$$30 - 15 = 15 = (3 \cdot 5)$$
$$15 - 15 = 0$$

    <p>
    at which point, according to the algorithm, we take the last non-zero difference
    and claim that it is the GCD in question:
    </p>

$$gcd(525, 60) = 15$$

    <p>
    In a modernized language that is what Euclid did in his <dfn>"Elements"</dfn>,
    Book 7 Proposition 2.
    </p>

    <p>
    The last thing that remains for us to do is to realize that the chain of consecutive
    subtractions is none other than the Division Algorithm in the expanded form. So
    if we compress our steps and compute the remainders of division of the larger
    number by the smaller one until zero remainder is reached, we will arrive at the
    modern form of the Euclidean GCD Algorithm:
    </p>

$$\begin{array}{rcrcrcl}
525 & - & 8 \cdot 60 & = & 45 & = & 3 \cdot (3 \cdot 5) \\
60 & - & 1 \cdot 45 & = & 15 & = & (3 \cdot 5) \\
45 & - & 3 \cdot 15 & = & 0 \\
\end{array}$$

    <p>
    where, in the intermediate steps, we repetitively promoted the old \(b\) into the
    new \(a\) and the old \(r\) into the new \(b\).
    </p>

    <p>
    And in the modern setting, after all the work that we have done so far, we should
    have no trouble proving rigorously that our earlier intuitive thinking is in fact
    mathematically correct:
    </p>

    <p>
    If \(d\) is a GCD of two integers \(a\) and \(b\), then, being their common factor,
    according to our LC-Theorem, \(d\) divides their arbitrary linear combination,
    including this one:
    </p>

$$a - q \cdot b = r$$

    <p>
    But the above linear combination yields \(r\) - the remainder of division of \(a\)
    by \(b\) - according to the Division Algorithm. Hence, \(d\) also divides both \(b\)
    and \(r\). Conversely, if \(f\) is some arbitrary common factor of \(b\) and \(r\)
    then it too, according to the LC-Theorem, must divide their arbitrary linear
    combination, including this one:
    </p>

$$r + q \cdot b = a$$

    <p>
    But the above linear combination yields \(a\) and, hence, \(f\) also divides both
    \(a\) and \(b\). But according to the GCD definition, \(f \leqslant d\), which means
    that indeed \(d\) is a GCD of \(b\) and \(r\) also.
    </p>

    <p>
    In our example:
    </p>

$$gcd(525, 60) = 15$$
$$525 - 8 \cdot 60 = 45 = r$$
$$gcd(60, 45) = 15 = gcd(525, 60)$$

    <p>
    So in fact we went through the following GCD chain:
    </p>

$$gcd(525, 60) = gcd(60, 45) = gcd(45, 15) = gcd( 15, 0) = 15$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>5) Why Does It Always Terminate?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    There are three factors that contribute to the fact that the Euclidean GCD Algorithm
    always terminates:
    </p>

    <p>
    5.1) the algorithm only deals with whole numbers at all times
    </p>

    <p>
    5.2) \(b\) and the consecutive remainders \(r\) are strictly decreasing due to the
    Division Algorithm
    </p>

    <p>
    5.3) there is a hard lower bound for the above numbers, zero, which means that since
    the distance between \(b\) and zero is finite then the set of all the remainders can
    not contain more than \(b\) items (integers) - a manifestation of well ordering of
    the natural numbers
    </p>

    <p> 
    We may also observe that a given pair of numbers is not special - the \((60, 45)\) pair,
    from the consecutive subtraction stand point, is no different than the \((45, 30)\)
    pair or the original \((525, 60)\) pair. The first two pairs of integers
    <dfn>diminish</dfn> in their respective magnitudes but nothing prevents us from going
    in the opposite direction and manufacturing thus related pairs of <dfn>increasing</dfn>
    magnitudes.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, the numbers that we now qualify as original, \(525\) and \(60\), may very
    well be interpreted as the intermediate terms in a different, and bigger, chain of a
    GCD computation of yet another pair of numbers. If we work our way in the opposite
    direction and <dfn>demote</dfn> the term \(b = 60\) to become \(r\) and demote the term
    \(a = 525\) to become \(b\) then we will have:
    </p>

$$1635 - 3 \cdot 525 = 60$$
$$a = 1635, b = 525, r = 60$$

    <p>
    where \(q = 3\) was pulled out of thin air. One more time:
    </p>

$$3795 - 2 \cdot 1635 = 525$$
$$a = 3795, b = 1635, r = 525$$

    <p>
    And so on. We see that if we demote \(b\) into \(r\) and \(a\) into \(b\) then, with
    some frivolity of choosing \(q\), we will generate non-unique pairs of magnitudes that
    increase without bound while if we promote \(b\) into \(a\) and \(r\) into \(b\) then
    we will produce unique pairs of strictly decreasing magnitudes.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>6) No Commonality</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We now should have no problems following the Euclidean GCD Algorithm when it is
    applied to two coprimes. For example:
    </p>

$$a = 175 = 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$$
$$b = 22 = 2 \cdot 11$$
$$\begin{array}{rcrcrcl}
175 & - & 7 \cdot 22 & = & 21 & = & 3 \cdot 7 \\
22 & - & 1 \cdot 21 & = & 1 & = & 1 \\
21 & - & 21 \cdot 1 & = & 0
\end{array}$$
$$gcd(175, 22) = 1$$

    <p>
    You are encouraged to perform the above canonical computation in an expanded,
    Euclidean, form of consecutive subtractions.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>7) Interpretations</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We can think of two pretty much identical interpretations of the Euclidean GCD
    Algorithm: one- and two-dimensional.
    </p>

    <p>
    The one-dimensional interpretation is quite literal: we treat \(a, b\) and \(r\)
    as lengths of line segments. Between the two line segments \(a\) and \(b\) we
    always choose the shorter one, say \(b\), as a yard stick with which we measure
    the longer one, say \(a\), for as long as possible - until the leftover line
    segment \(r\), shorter than \(b\), remains:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/gcd1d.png" alt="GCD 1d" class="center">

    <p>
    at which point we carry out the following substitutions: turn the formerly shorter
    line segment \(b\) into the newly longer one \(a\) and make the line segment \(r\)
    be the new yard stick \(b\). Repeat the above process as long as the length of the
    leftover line segment \(r\) is not zero. The GCD in question then, by magnitude, is
    the length of the previous, nonzero length, line segment \(r\).
    </p>

    <p>
    With the two-dimensional interpretation we treat \(a\) and \(b\) as the sides of a
    rectangle. The GCD in question then, by magnitude, is the largest possible side of
    a square that can tile, or cover, the given \(a \times b\) rectangle perfectly -
    without any gaps and without any overlaps.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once the given \(a \times b\) rectangle is constructed, the process of finding of
    the above <dfn>largest</dfn> square uses the one-dimensional algorithm described
    earlier: we use the smaller side, say \(b\), to construct as many \(b \times b\)
    squares inside the original rectangle as possible. After \(q\) such squares tile
    the \(a \times b\) rectangle, a new, \(b \times r\), rectangle will remain not
    covered (here \(r = a - qb\)):
    </p>

<img src="imgs/gcd2d.png" alt="GCD 2d" class="center">

    <p>
    At which point we perform the familiar now substitution: we turn the old, smaller,
    side \(b\) into the new, longer, side \(a\) and we treat the, old, side \(r\) as
    a new, shorter, side \(b\). We now cover the new \(a \times b\), formerly
    \(b \times r\), rectangle with as many new \(b \times b\), formerly \(r \times r\),
    rectangles as possible until the current \(a \times b\) rectangle is covered by
    the \(b \times b\) square perfectly. The GCD in question, then, is equal to the
    length of the side of that last \(b \times b\) square.
