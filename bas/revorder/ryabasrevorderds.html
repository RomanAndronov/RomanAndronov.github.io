    <h1>Devil, Swans</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>The Devil and the Loiterer</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    The Devil offers a loiterer a deal:
    </p>

    <p>
    - Every time you cross that bridge the amount of money in your pocket will
    triple.
    </p>

    <p>
    - What is the catch?
    </p>

    <p>
    - After each bridge crossing give me back just 27 bucks.
    </p>

    <p>
    - Deal!
    </p>
 
    <p>
    After three bridge crossings the loiterer was left with empty pockets.
    </p>
 
    <p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    How much money did the loiterer originally have?
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Solution I</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In an attempt to solve this problem with a traditional or forward logic we
    let \(x\) be the original amount of money in the loiterer's pocket before
    the first bridge crossing.
    </p>

    <p>
    Immediately after the first bridge crossing the amount of money in loiterer's
    pockets triples becoming \(3x\). After the Devil takes his first cut the
    amount of money that the loiterer is left with becomes:
    </p>

$$3x - 27$$

    <p>
    Right after the second crossing the loiterer has:
    </p>

$$3 \times (3x - 27)$$

    <p>
    After the Devil takes his second cut that sum of money becomes:
    </p>

$$3 \times (3x - 27) - 27$$

    <p>
    Right after the third crossing the loiterer has:
    </p>

$$3 \times (3 \times (3x - 27) - 27)$$

    <p>
    in his/her pocket and after the devil takes his third cut that sum becomes
    zero:
    </p>

$$3 \times (3 \times (3x - 27) - 27) - 27 = 0$$

    <p>
    Solving the above equation for \(x\) we obtain:
    </p>

$$x = 13$$

    <p>
    where I have made up the numbers for a cheap thrill.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Solution II</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Solving this problem using the Reverse Order approach we start with the
    third bridge crossing and proceed backward step by step toward the
    <dfn>"before the \(1\)-st crossing"</dfn> state. We also reverse the meaning
    of the arithmetic operators because the nature of the problem calls for it.
    In a different problem we will reverse something else - whatever is more
    appropriate. In this particular case subtraction becomes addition,
    multiplication - division.
    </p>

    <p>
    To make keeping track of state transitions easier we write them down in a
    normal order but follow them in reverse order to obtain a solution:
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>before the \(1-\)st crossing</li>
     <li>after \(1-\)st crossing</li>
     <li>Devil takes his \(1-\)st cut</li>
     <li>after the \(2-\)nd crossing</li>
     <li>Devil takes his \(2-\)nd cut</li>
     <li>after the \(3-\)rd crossing</li>
     <li>Devil takes his \(3-\)rd cut</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    We now start at the very bottom of the list in the <dfn>"Devil takes his
    \(3-\)rd cut"</dfn> state and move upward one state at a time.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since after the <dfn>"Devil takes his \(3-\)rd cut"</dfn> state no money is
    left in the loiterer's pocket then, working backwards, before that state the
    loiterer must have:
    </p>

$$0 + 27 = 27$$

    <p>
    dollars in his/her pocket. The loiterer now is in the <dfn>"after the
    \(3-\)rd crossing state"</dfn> with \($27\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Let the loiterer cross the bridge backwards with \($27\) into the
    <dfn>"Devil takes his \(2-\)nd cut"</dfn> state and instead of multiplying
    the amount of money in his/her pocket divide it by \(3\):
    </p>

$$27 \div 3 = 9$$

    <p>
    The loiterer now has \($9\) in the <dfn>"Devil takes his \(2-\)nd cut"</dfn>
    state.
    </p>

    <p>
    To perform the action of the above state in reverse order we add \($27\) to
    the amount of money in loiterer's possession instead of subtracting it:
    </p>

$$9 + 27 = 36$$

    <p>
    which puts the loiterer into the <dfn>"after the \(2\)-nd crossing"</dfn>
    state with \($36\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Perform the \(2-\)nd bridge crossing in reverse order by dividing instead of
    multiplying:
    </p>

$$36 \div 3 = 12$$

    <p>
    The loiterer now is in the <dfn>"Devil takes his \(1\)-st cut"</dfn> state
    with \($12\). Perform the <dfn>"takes"</dfn> action in reverse order by
    turning it into the <dfn>"gives"</dfn> action:
    </p>

$$12 + 27 = 39$$

    <p>
    The loiterer now is in the <dfn>"after the \(1\)-st crossing"</dfn> state
    with \($39\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, perform the \(1\)-st bridge crossing in reverse order:
    </p>

$$39 \div 3 = 13$$

    <p>
    The loiterer now is in the <dfn>"before the \(1\)-st crossing"</dfn> state
    with \($13\) - the answer to the original question.
    </p>

    <p>
    We observe that computationally the steps that lead to a solution via Reverse
    Order were less intensive than the steps that lead to a solution via the
    forward logic since we did not have to solve any equations at all - we just
    had to carry out a single arithmetic operation at a time.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since this problem may seem somewhat contrived and not very convincing, let
    us look at a more revealing problem.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Swan Lakes</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    A flock of swans is approaching a group of lakes. Every time the swans are
    flying over a lake one half of them plus half-a-swan land while the
    remaining swans fly toward the next lake. In that fashion all the swans
    land on 7 lakes.
    </p>
     
    <p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    How many swans were in the flock?
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Solution I</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In an attempt to solve this problem via forward logic let \(x\) be the number
    of swans that approached the first lake. Then the number of swans that landed
    on the first lake is:
    </p>

$$\frac {x}{2} + \frac {1}{2}$$

    <p>
    The number of swans that flew toward the second lake is:
    </p>

$$x - \Big(\frac {x}{2} + \frac {1}{2}\Big) = \frac {x}{2} - \frac {1}{2}$$

    <p>
    The number of swans that landed on the second lake is:
    </p>

$$\frac {\Big(\frac {x}{2} - \frac {1}{2}\Big)}{2} + \frac {1}{2} =
 \frac {x}{4} + \frac {1}{4}$$

    <p>
    The number of swans that flew toward the third lake is:
    </p>

$$\frac {x}{2} - \frac {1}{2} - \Big(\frac {x}{4} + \frac {1}{4}\Big) =
\frac {x}{4} - \frac {3}{4}$$

    <p>
    If we continue in the above fashion we will eventually arrive at the number
    of swans that approached the \(7-\)th lake:
    </p>

$$\frac {x}{64} - \frac {63}{64}$$

    <p>
    Consequently, the number of swans that landed on this lake will be:
    </p>

$$\frac {x}{128} + \frac {1}{128}$$

    <p>
    which must be equal to the number of swans that approached the last lake:
    </p>

$$\frac {x}{64} - \frac {63}{64} = \frac {x}{128} + \frac {1}{128}$$

    <p>
    Solving the above equation for \(x\) we obtain:
    </p>

$$x = 127$$

    <p>
    We now ask ourselves: "What if all the swans landed over \(1,000\) lakes?"
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Solution II</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    As Reverse Order prescribes let us start with the state in which all the swans
    have landed. According to the problem statement this event has occurred on the
    \(7-\)the lake.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let \(x\) be the number of swans that approached the \(7-\)th lake. Then the
    number of swans that landed there:
    </p>

$$\frac {x}{2} + \frac {1}{2}$$

    <p>
    must be equal to the number of swans that approached that lake:
    </p>

$$x = \frac {x}{2} + \frac {1}{2}$$
$$2x = x + 1$$
$$x = 1$$
     
    <p>
    We may also obtain the same result by observing that since all the swans have
    landed across \(7\) lakes it means that exactly zero swans flew toward the
    \(8-\)th lake:
    </p>

$$0 = x - \Big(\frac {x}{2} + \frac {1}{2}\Big) = \frac {x}{2} - \frac {1}{2}$$
$$x = 1$$

    <p>
    We observe right away that with Reverse Order the above result does not
    depend on the absolute value of the last lake - even if all the swans would
    have landed across \(1,000,000\) lakes the value of \(x\) would still be
    \(1\).
    </p>

    <p>
    We now know that \(1\) swan approached and landed on the \(7\)-th lake. That
    number, \(1\), represents the difference between the number of swans \(x\)
    that approached the \(6\)-th lake and the number of swans that have landed
    there which formulaically remains the same:
    </p>

$$x - \Big(\frac {x}{2} + \frac {1}{2}\Big) = 1$$

    <p>
    and we obtain that:
    </p>

$$x = 3$$

    <p>
    swans approached the \(6\)-th lake. It follows then that for the number of
    swans that approached the \(5\)-th lake we have:
    </p>

$$x - \Big(\frac {x}{2} + \frac {1}{2}\Big) = 3$$
$$x = 7$$

    <p>
    and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    We argue that even if, for a small number of lakes, we were to run the entire
    computation by hand it would be less laborious and error-prone than its
    forward logic counterpart.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, even around the \(6-\)th or \(5-\)th lake we should be able to
    recognize the following pattern: every time we move to the previous lake we
    multiply the current number of swans by two and subtract one. Consecutive
    multiplication, by two, is exponentiation, and, hence, we construct the number
    of swans that Approach the \(k-\)th lake \(A_k^7\) in closed form as:
    </p>

$$A_k^7 = 2^{7 - k + 1} - 1$$

    <p>
    from where it follows that for the number of swans that have approached the
    \(k = 1-\)st lake we have:
    </p>

$$A_1^7 = 2^7 - 1 = 127$$

    <p>
    For completeness, the number of swans that Lands on the \(k-\)th lake is:
    </p>

$$L_k^7 = A_k^7 \times 2^{-1} + 2^{-1} =$$
$$2^{7 - k} \times 2^1 \times 2^{-1} - 2^{-1} + 2^{-1} =$$
$$2^{7 - k}$$

    <p>
    We now generalize the problem for \(7 = n\) as:
    </p>

$$A_k^n = 2^{n - k + 1} - 1$$
$$L_k^n = 2^{n - k}, \quad k \in [1, n]$$
