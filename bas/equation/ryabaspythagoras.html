    <h1>Pythagorean Theorem</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Prove that for any right triangle with sides \(a\) and \(b\) and a hypotenuse
    \(c\):
    </p>

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Approach</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    To prove this theorem we will use the Equation approach in the following way.
    We will compute the magnitude of a radius of the inscribed circle of an
    arbitrary right triangle in two different ways and then we will equate the
    two magnitudes since they refer to the same geometric object.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let:
    </p>

$$AB = a$$
$$BC = b$$
$$CA = c$$
$$\angle BAC = \alpha$$

    <p>
    The center of the inscribed circle of an arbitrary triangle, not necessarily
    a right one, is located on the intersection of the bisectors of the internal
    angles of a triangle - the point \(O\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pythagoras.png" alt="Pythagorean Theorem" class="center">

    <p>
    <br><strong>Solution I</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    is based on the observation that:
    </p>

$$c = AC = AF + CF$$

    <p>
    By construction the triangles \(\triangle OFA\) and \(\triangle OEA\) are
    right and hence the right angles \(\angle OFA\) and \(\angle OEA\) are equal.
    </p>

    <p>
    The angles at \(A\), \(\angle FAO\) and \(\angle EAO\), are also equal by
    construction. From Euclid's <dfn>"Elements"</dfn> Book 1 Proposition 32 it
    follows that the remaining internal angles, \(\angle FOA\) and \(\angle EOA\),
    are also equal. By <strong>AAA</strong> then these triangles are similar.
    </p>

    <p>
    From Book 6 Proposition 4 it follows that:
    </p>

$$AE = AF$$

    <p>
    since, by construction:
    </p>

$$OF = OE = r$$

    <p>
    and the side \(AO\) is common.
    </p>

    <p>
    Then:
    </p>
 
$$AB = a = AE + EB =$$
$$AE + r$$
$$\begin{equation}AE = a - r = AF\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Since:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}AC = c = AF + CF\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    put \(AF\) from (1) into (2):
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}c = a - r + CF\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    We can prove that \(CD = CF\) in the same way we have already proved that
    \(AE = AF\) and hence:
    </p>

$$CB = b = CD + DB =$$
$$CD + r$$
$$\begin{equation}CD = b - r = CF\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Put \(CF\) from (4) into (3):
    </p>
 
$$c = a - r + CF =$$
$$a - r + b - r =$$
$$a + b - 2r$$
$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{r = \frac {a + b - c}{2}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Solution II</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    is based on a combination of Equation and Division approaches - the square
    area of the entire triangle \(\triangle ABC\):
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
A_{\triangle ABC} = \frac {ab}{2}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    is equal to the sum of square areas of triangles that comprise it:
    </p>

$$A_{\triangle ABC} = A_{\triangle BOA} + A_{\triangle BOC} +
A_{\triangle COA} =$$
$$\frac {ra}{2} + \frac {rb}{2} + \frac {rc}{2}=$$
$$\begin{equation}
r \frac {a + b + c}{2}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    since the height of each smaller triangle is equal to \(r\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/pythagoras.png" alt="Pythagorean Theorem" class="center">

    <p>
    Equate (6) and (7):
    </p>
 
$$\frac {ab}{2} = r \frac {a + b + c}{2}$$
$$\begin{equation}
r = \frac {ab}{a + b + c}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Now equate (5) and (8):
    </p>

$$\frac {a + b - c}{2} = \frac {ab}{a + b + c}$$
$$2ab = a^2 + ab + ac + ba + b^2 + bc - ca - cb - c^2$$
$$2ab = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 -c^2$$
$$0 = a^2 + b^2 - c^2$$
$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{a^2 + b^2 = c^2}$$

    <p>
    what was required to prove.
    </p>

    <p>
    We remark in passing that the Pythagorean Theorem for some reason has caught
    the public eye - by now there are more than \(300\) proofs of this theorem
    available.
