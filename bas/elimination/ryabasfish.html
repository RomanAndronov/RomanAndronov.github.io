    <h1>Who Owns the Fish?</h1>

    <p>
    This puzzle comes in many guises, this is one of them.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Five people of different ethnic backgrounds - a <strong>Briton</strong>, a
    <strong>Dane</strong>, a <strong>Swede</strong>, a <strong>Norwegian</strong>
    and a <strong>German</strong> - live in a row of five houses each of which is
    painted one of five different colors - <strong>blue</strong>,
    <strong>red</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, <strong>yellow</strong> and
    <strong>white</strong>. Each person lives in only one house, owns only one
    type of pet, drinks only one type of drink and plays only one type of sport.
    </p>

    <p>
    The drinks are - <strong>tea</strong>, <strong>coffee</strong>,
    <strong>milk</strong>, <strong>water</strong>, <strong>beer</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The pets are - <strong>horses</strong>, <strong>birds</strong>,
    <strong>dogs</strong>, <strong>cats</strong> and <strong>fish</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The sports are - <strong>baseball</strong>, <strong>volleyball</strong>,
    <strong>football</strong>, <strong>hockey</strong> and <strong>tennis</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Given the following fifteen initial facts:
    </p>

    <p>
    \(f1:\) The Briton lives in the red house<br>
    \(f2:\) The Swede owns dogs<br>
    \(f3:\) The Dane drinks tea<br>
    \(f4:\) The green house is on the left of the white house<br>
    \(f5:\) The owner of the green house drinks coffee<br>
    \(f6:\) The owner who plays football owns birds<br>
    \(f7:\) The owner of the yellow house plays baseball<br>
    \(f8:\) The owner of the center house drinks milk<br>
    \(f9:\) The Norwegian lives in the first house<br>
    \(f10:\) The owner who plays volleyball lives next to the one who has
    cats<br>
    \(f11:\) The owner who keeps horses lives next to the one who plays
    baseball<br>
    \(f12:\) The owner who plays tennis drinks beer<br>
    \(f13:\) The German plays hockey<br>
    \(f14:\) The Norwegian lives next to the blue house<br>
    \(f15:\) The owner who plays volleyball has a neighbor who drinks
    water<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    Answer the following question: who owns the fish?
    </p>

    <p>
    To make sure that this problem has only one solution derived at by pure logic
    without any guessing let us disambiguate the following:
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(f4\) means <dfn>immediately</dfn> on the left
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(f10, \; f11, \; f14\) and \(f15\) all mean <dfn>immediately</dfn> on either
    left or right
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <br><strong>Solution</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We are given five items - houses - each of which has five attributes attached
    to it:
    </p>

    <ul>
     <li>a color</li>
     <li>a person</li>
     <li>a drink</li>
     <li>a sport</li>
     <li>a pet</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    We also have the sixth attribute - an ordinal position or number of a house
    but we will keep this attribute out of the above mix since we will use it
    to make each house unique or distinct, only once, by arbitrarily assigning
    house numbers in the traditional left to right fashion: the left-most or the
    first house will be the house number \(1\), the middle or center house will
    be the house number \(3\) and the right-most or the last house will be the
    house number \(5\).
    </p>

    <p>
    The order in which the remaining attributes are distributed across the houses
    is very important - whether, say, the first house is owned by a
    <strong>Swede</strong> or a <strong>Briton</strong> makes all the difference.
    </p>

    <p>
    It follows then that five unique individuals, for example, can be distributed
    across five uniquely numbered houses in:
    </p>

$$5! = 120$$

    <p>
    ways.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since the choices of the remaining attributes do not depend on the outcome
    of the selection of an individual attached to a house, from the Fundamental
    Multiplication Counting Principle it follows that five unique pets, five
    unique drinks, five unique sports and five unique colors distributed across
    five uniquely numbered houses generate a total of:
    </p>

$$5! \times 5! \times 5! \times 5! \times 5! = (5!)^5 =$$
$$30,517,578,125$$

    <p>
    possible arrangements.
    </p>

    <p>
    One, brute force, way to attempt to solve this problem is to generate all
    these arrangements and then check each one against the initial facts.
    An arrangement of attributes that satisfies all the initial facts is the right
    one and from that arrangement we can tell who owns the fish.
    </p>

    <p>
    If we write a computer program that is capable of testing \(10,000\)
    arrangements per second then it will take about \(35\) days to find the
    answer which is reasonable - on a faster computer it, in theory, could be
    done in about \(3.5\) days or even in about \(8\) hours.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us, however, see if we can solve this problem manually - by using the
    following elimination algorithm. We will scan the list of initial facts for
    clues in order to make a useful deduction which we will designate as \(d_1,
    d_2, d_3\), etc. Once such a deduction is made we shall add this deduction
    to the bottom of the list and repeat the process again until the problem is,
    hopefully, solved since the number of constraint, we anticipate, should
    constantly grow - each deduction should eliminate some number of choices for
    a given attribute so that eventually only one possible value for an attribute
    in question remains.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    While looking for clues we will use the idea perfected by the detectives -
    if a suspect keeps showing up multiple times in multiple places then he/she
    deserves a closer inspection. Consequently, if we come across a value of an
    attribute, <strong>German</strong>, <strong>red</strong>,
    <strong>tennis</strong>, <strong>birds</strong></dfn> and the like, mentioned
    in the list more than once then we will try to use that value first to make
    a useful deduction before moving on.
    </p>

    <p>
    What follows is the record of my solution - the order of your deductions may
    be different but the result should be the same.
    </p>

    <p>
    We shall use the following convention to record the deductions: on the left
    hand side of the equal sign we shall put the sum of all the facts from which
    the new deduction, recorded on the right hand side of the equal sign, follows.
    For example:
    </p>

$$f_4 = d_1$$

    <p>
    is read:
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>from the initial fact number four follows the deduction number one
    because ...</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    The explanation of why this particular deduction follows from this set of
    true statements is given in the paragraph right after.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(f4 = d1\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The \(\#1\) house is not <strong>white</strong>:</dfn> by definition no
    other house can be positioned to the left of the first house.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(f4 = d2\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The \(\#5\) house is not <strong>green</strong>:</dfn> by definition no
    other house can be positioned to the right of the last house.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(f5 + f8 = d3\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The \(\#3\) house is not <strong>green</strong>:</dfn> because the drinks
    do not match, <strong>coffee</strong> \(\not =\) <strong>milk</strong>, the
    color and the ordinal position of the house can not match either.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(f9 + f14 = d4\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The \(\#2\) house is <strong>blue</strong>:</dfn> the first house's only
    immediate neighbor, on its right, can only be a house \(\#2\) by its ordinal
    position. This deduction assigns the <strong>blue</strong> color to its
    absolute position. It also eliminates this position as a choice for all the
    remaining colors - <strong>red</strong>, <strong>green</strong>,
    <strong>yellow</strong> and <strong>white</strong> houses are not \(\#2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d4 = d5\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>None of the \(\#1, \#3, \#4\) and \(\#5\) houses are <strong>blue</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(f1 + f9 = d6\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The \(\#1\) house is not <strong>red</strong>:</dfn> because the ethnic
    backgrounds do not match, <strong>Briton</strong> \(\not =\)
    <strong>Norwegian</strong>, the color and the ordinal position of a house can
    not match either.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d4 + f4 = d7\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The \(\#1\) house is not <strong>green</strong>:</dfn> the house
    immediately to the right of the <strong>green</strong> house is
    <strong>white</strong> and the house immediately to the right of the first
    house is <strong>blue</strong>. Because the colors of the right neighbors do
    not match, <strong>blue</strong> \(\not =\) <strong>white</strong>, the
    ordinal position, \(\#1\), and the color, <strong>green</strong>, can not
    match either.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d1 + d5 + d6 + d7 = d8\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The \(\#1\) house is <strong>yellow</strong>:</dfn> this is the only color
    left for the first house. All the other house color choices for that ordinal
    position have been eliminated.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d2 + d3 + d4 + d8 = d9\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>green</strong> house is \(\#4\):</dfn> this is the only
    ordinal position left for the <strong>green</strong> house. All the other
    position choices for that color have been eliminated.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(f4 + d9 = d10\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>white</strong> house is \(\#5\):</dfn> this is the only
    ordinal position left for the <strong>white</strong> house. All the other
    ordinal position choices for that color have been eliminated.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d4 + d8 + d9 + d10 = d11\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>red</strong> house where the <strong>Briton</strong> lives
    is \(\#3\):</dfn> this is the only color left for the third (center) house.
    All the other color choices for that ordinal position have been eliminated.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(f1 + f8 + d11 = d12\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>Briton</strong> drinks <strong>milk</strong>:</dfn>
    because the ordinal position and the color of the house match, the center
    house is <strong>red</strong>, so do the owner and the drink.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(f9 + d8 + f7 = d13\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>Norwegian</strong> plays <strong>baseball</strong>:</dfn>
    because the ordinal position and the color of the house match, the first
    house is <strong>yellow</strong>, so do the owner and the sport.
    </p>

    <p>
    Two attributes - the ordinal position and the color - are now fully
    determined. Considering all the deductions we have made so far here is the
    state of the problem:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/fish1.png" alt="Fish 1" class="center">

    <p>
    <br>\(f11 + d13 = d14\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The owner of the <strong>blue</strong> house keeps
    <strong>horses</strong>:</dfn> <strong>horses</strong> can be on either left
    or right side of the person who plays <strong>baseball</strong>. That person
    lives in the very first house. By its definition the first house has no
    immediate neighbor on its left - only on its right. And that is the
    <strong>blue</strong> house \(\#2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(f3 = d15\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>Norwegian</strong> does not drink <strong>tea</strong>:</dfn>
    because the ethnic backgrounds do not match, <strong>Dane</strong> \(\not =\)
    <strong>Norwegian</strong>, the drinks can not match either.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(f5 + d8 = d16\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>Norwegian</strong> does not drink <strong>coffee</strong>:
    </dfn> because the colors do not match, <strong>yellow</strong> \(\not =\)
    <strong>green</strong>, the drinks can not match either.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(f8 + f9 = d17\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>Norwegian</strong> does not drink <strong>milk</strong>:
    </dfn> because the ordinal positions of the houses do not match, first
    \(\not =\) third (center), the drinks can not match either.
    </p>

    <p>
    Another reasoning: <strong>milk</strong> is the drink at the
    <strong>red</strong> house which is not <strong>yellow</strong>. Since the
    colors do not match the drinks can not match either.
    </p>

    <p>
    And another: since <strong>milk</strong> is the drink at the
    <strong>red</strong> (center) house it can not be the drink at any,
    <strong>yellow</strong> including, remaining house color (position).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d13 + f12 = d18\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>Norwegian</strong> does not drink <strong>beer</strong>:
    </dfn> because the sports do not match, <strong>tennis</strong> \(\not =\)
    <strong>baseball</strong>, the drinks can not match either.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d15 + d16 + d17 + d18 = d19\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>Norwegian</strong> drinks <strong>water</strong>:</dfn>
    that is the only drink left for the <strong>Norwegian</strong>. All the other
    drink choices for that person have been eliminated.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d19 + f15 = d20\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The owner of the <strong>blue</strong> house plays
    <strong>volleyball</strong>:</dfn> the <strong>volleyball</strong> player can
    be on either left or right side of the house whose owner drinks
    <strong>water</strong>. Because that person lives in the first house he has
    only one neighbor - on its right side - the owner of the <strong>blue</strong>
    house who plays <strong>volleyball</strong>:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/fish2.png" alt="Fish 2" class="center">

    <p>
    <br>\(f12 + d19 + d12 + f5 + d20 = d21\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The owner of the <strong>white</strong> house drinks
    <strong>beer</strong>:</dfn> because the drinks do not match,
    <strong>beer</strong> \(\not =\) <strong>water</strong> \(\not =\)
    <strong>milk</strong> \(\not =\) <strong>coffee</strong>, the colors,
    <strong>yellow</strong>, <strong>red</strong> and <strong>green</strong>, can
    not match either and are eliminated. Because the sports do not match,
    <strong>tennis</strong> \(\not =\) <strong>volleyball</strong>, the only
    remaining house color choice, <strong>blue</strong>, is also eliminated.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d21 + f12 = d22\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The owner of the <strong>white</strong> house plays
    <strong>tennis</strong>:</dfn> because the drinks match,
    <strong>beer</strong> \(=\) <strong>beer</strong>, the color and the sport
    must match also.

    <p>
    <br>\(d19 + d12 + f5 + d21 = d23\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The owner of the <strong>blue</strong> house drinks
    <strong>tea</strong>:</dfn> that is the only drink left for the person who
    lives in the <strong>blue</strong> house. All the other drink choices for
    the owner of that house have been eliminated.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d23 + f3 = d24\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>Dane</strong> lives in the <strong>blue</strong> house:</dfn>
    because the drinks match, <strong>tea</strong> \(=\) <strong>tea</strong>,
    the owner and the color of the house must match also:

    <img src="imgs/fish3.png" alt="Fish 3" class="center">

    <p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>hockey</strong>-playing <strong>German</strong> lives in
    the <strong>green</strong> house:</dfn> because the ethnic backgrounds do not
    match, <strong>German</strong> \(\not =\) <strong>Norwegian</strong>
    \(\not =\) <strong>Dane</strong> \(\not =\) <strong>Briton</strong>, the
    house colors and ordinal positions can not match either and are eliminated.
    Because the sports do not match, <strong>tennis</strong> \(\not =\)
    <strong>hockey</strong>, the remaining color, <strong>white</strong>, is
    also eliminated.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d8 + d24 + d11 + d25 = d26\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>Swede</strong> lives in the <strong>white</strong> house:</dfn>
    this is the only ethnic background choice left for the owner of the
    <strong>white</strong> house. All the other ethnic background choices for the
    owner of the house of that color have been eliminated.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d13 + d20 + d22 + d25 = d27\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>Briton</strong> plays <strong>football</strong>:</dfn> this
    is the only sport choice left for the <strong>Briton</strong>. All the other
    sport choices for that person have been eliminated:

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>Briton</strong> raises <strong>birds</strong>:</dfn> because
    the sports match, <strong>football</strong> \(=\) <strong>football</strong>,
    the owner and the pet must match also.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d28 + f10 = d29\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>Norwegian</strong> keeps <strong>cats</strong>:</dfn> the
    cat owner can be on either left or right side of the
    <strong>volleyball</strong> player. The right neighbor of the
    <strong>volleyball</strong> player raises <strong>birds</strong> and because
    the pets do not match, <strong>birds</strong> \(\not = \)
    <strong>cats</strong>, that neighbor is eliminated.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>\(d29 + d14 + d28 + f2 = d30\)
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>The <strong>German</strong> owns the <strong>fish</strong>:</dfn> that

    pet choices for that person have been eliminated:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/fish5.png" alt="Fish 5" class="center">

    <p>
    So the answer is: the <strong>German</strong> who lives in the number four
    <strong>green</strong> house, drinks <strong>coffee</strong> and plays
    <strong>hockey</strong> owns the <strong>fish</strong>.
