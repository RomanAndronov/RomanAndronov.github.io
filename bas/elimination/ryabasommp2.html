    <h1>Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 2</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    A math professor \(R\)(iddler) tells two math students, \(S\)(um) and
    \(P\)(roduct), so that both can hear:
    </p>

    <p>
    - I have two non-equal natural numbers in mind: both are greater than one and
    their sum is less than \(100\). To \(P\) I will whisper their product so that
    \(S\) can not hear it (and \(R\) does). To \(S\) I will whisper their sum so
    that \(P\) can not hear it (and \(R\) does). 
    </p>

    <p>
    Later on the following dialog between \(P\) and \(S\) ensues:
    </p>

    <p>
    \(P\): I can not name these numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
    \(S\): I knew ahead of time that you would not be able to.
    </p>

    <p>
    \(P\): But then I know them!
    </p>

    <p>
    \(S\): But then so do I!
    </p>

    <p>
    Assuming that all the participants speak the truth at all times, what are
    these numbers?
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Analytic Solution</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Let \(x\) and \(y\) be the natural numbers in question and let \(\sigma\) and
    \(\rho\) be their sum and product correspondingly:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation} 2 \leqslant x \leqslant 97 \end{equation}$$
$$\begin{equation} 2 \leqslant y \leqslant 97 \end{equation}$$
$$\sigma = x + y$$
$$\begin{equation} 4 \leqslant \sigma \leqslant 99 \end{equation}$$
$$\rho = x \times y$$
$$\begin{equation} 4 \leqslant \rho \leqslant 2,450 \end{equation}$$

    <p>
    An upper bound of \(\rho\) can be obtained programmatically or analytically.
    In the latter case we observe that when a sum of two numbers is fixed:
    </p>

$$x + y = \sigma$$
$$y = \sigma - x$$

    <p>
    then their product can be written as:
    </p>

$$\rho(x) = x \times y = x(\sigma - x) = \sigma x - x^2$$

    <p>
    which may have a maximum if \(\rho(x)\) is continuous on a closed interval,
    which it is:
    </p>

$$\rho_x'(x) = \sigma - 2x$$
$$\sigma - 2x = 0$$
$$x_{max} = \frac{\sigma}{2}$$

    <p>
    from where we conclude that when a sum of two (natural nonnegative) numbers
    is fixed then their product reaches a maximum when the numbers are equal one
    another.
    </p>

    <p>
    The same result may be obtained without calculus by recalling the theorem
    which states that a geometric mean of two nonnegative numbers never exceeds
    the corresponding arithmetic mean:
    </p>

$$\sqrt{x \times y} \leqslant \frac {x + y}{2} = \frac {\sigma}{2}$$

    <p>
    It follows then that since the product of two such numbers is bound from
    above:
    </p>

$$x \times y \leqslant \frac {\sigma^2}{4} =
 \frac{\sigma}{2} \times \frac{\sigma}{2}$$

    <p>
    it reaches its maximum when:
    </p>

$$x = y = \frac {\sigma}{2}$$

    <p>
    In our case:
    </p>

$$x = y = \frac{99}{2} = 49.5$$

    <p>
    Since our numbers must be natural, we take the fractional part away from one
    of them and give it to the other:
    </p>

$$50 \times 49 = 2,450$$

    <p>
    <br>1) For ease of reference let us number the statements made by each
    student as:
    </p>

$$P_1, P_2, S_1, S_2$$

    <p>
    so that for the record:
    </p>

    <p>
    \(P_1 = \) "I can not name these numbers"<br>
    \(S_2 =\) "I knew ahead of time that you would not be able to"<br>
    \(P_2 =\) "But then I know them!"<br>
    \(S_2 =\) "But then so do I!"
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>2) Let us negate \(P_1\) (by putting an exclamation mark in front of it):
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    \(!P_1 =\) "I can name these numbers and they are ..."
    </p>

    <p>
    When \(P\) would be able to announce \(!P_1\)?
    </p>

    <p>
    2.1) The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic or the Prime Factorization Theorem
    (PFT) states that any natural number greater than one is either prime
    already or is representable as a unique product of primes if the order of
    primes is ignored. The guarantee of uniqueness of factorization is what
    makes this theorem so useful to us.
    </p>

    <p>
    From PFT it follows that \(P\) would able to announce \(!P_1\) if \(x\) and
    \(y\) were both prime numbers that sum to \(99\) or less. For example, if
    \(21\) was whispered to \(P\) then, since:
    </p>

$$\rho = 21 = 3 \times 7$$
$$\sigma = 3 + 7 = 10 \leqslant 99$$

    <p>
    and \(3\) and \(7\) are both prime, \(P\) would have done the above
    computations and would have announced \(!P_1\).
    </p>

    <p>
    2.2) \(P\) would also be able to announce \(!P_1\) if (s)he were given a
    number that can be represented as:
    </p>

$$\rho = p \times p^2 = p^3 \; \colon \; p^2 < 100$$

    <p>
    where \(p\) is prime. For example, if one of the following numbers were
    whispered to \(P\):
    </p>

$$\rho = 8 = 2 \times 4, \quad \sigma = 2 + 4 = 6 \leqslant 99$$
$$\rho = 27 = 3 \times 9, \quad \sigma = 3 + 9 = 12 \leqslant 99$$
$$\rho = 125 = 5 \times 25, \quad \sigma = 5 + 25 = 30 \leqslant 99$$
$$\rho = 343 = 7 \times 49, \quad \sigma = 7 + 49 = 56 \leqslant 99$$

    <p>
    then (s)he would have done the above computations and would have announces
    \(!P_1\).
    </p>

    <p>
    2.3) \(P\) would also be able to announce \(!P_1\) if (s)he were given a
    number that can be represented as:
    </p>

$$\rho = p \times q^2 \; \colon \; q^2 < 100, p + q < 100$$

    <p>
    where \(p\) and \(q\) are both prime. For example:
    </p>

$$\rho = 3 \times 11^2 = 3 \times 121 = 363$$
$$363 = 3 \times 121 = 11 \times 33, \quad \sigma = 11 + 33 = 44$$

    <p>
    from where \(P\) would eliminate the first pair of factors and announce
    \(!P_1\).
    </p>

    <p>
    2.4) However, we know that instead of saying \(!P_1\) what \(P\) really said
    was \(P_1\). Hence, \(!P_1\) is false and by negating the above observations
    we conclude that:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>\(EF_1\): it is not the case that \(x\) and \(y\) are both prime</dfn>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>\(EF_2\): \(\rho\) can not be expressed as a product of a unique pair
    of factors that sum to \(99\) or less</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    where \(EF\) designates <dfn>Elimination Filter</dfn> which we will use later
    and by "unique pair" we mean two numbers that, while satisfying all the (1)-(4)
    restrictions, can be deduced by \(P\) right away.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>3) We interpret \(S_1\) as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>\(EF_3\): any product of two numbers that sum to \(\sigma\) obey
    \(EF_1\) and \(EF_2\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>4) When \(S\) would not be able to announce \(S_1\)? In two cases:
    </p>

    <p>
    - when \(\sigma\) is representable as a sum of two primes
    </p>

    <p>
    - when there exists such a representation of \(\sigma = p + (\sigma - p)\)
    that the product \(p \times (\sigma - p)\) is representable as a unique pair
    of factors that sum to \(99\) or less
    </p>

    <p>
    In the first case two primes multiply to a unique product from which \(P\)
    can deduce the correct answer immediately. For example, if \(10\) was
    whispered to \(S\) then one possible pair of numbers that sums to \(10\) is:
    </p>

$$3 + 7 = 10$$

    <p>
    and since both terms are prime and sum to \(99\) or less, their product,
    possibly whispered to \(P\), violates \(EF_1\) and \(EF_2\), in which case
    \(P\) would be able to announce the correct answer right away and \(S\) would
    not be able to announce \(S_1\).
    </p>

    <p>
    In the second case the two numbers that sum to \(\sigma\) need not be both
    prime as long as they may multiply to a product \(\rho\) representable as a
    unique pair of factors that sum to \(99\) or less. For example, if \(12\)
    was whispered to \(S\) then there exists such a representation of \(\sigma\):

$$\sigma = 12 = 3 + 9 = 3 + (12 - 3)$$

    <p>
    that the product:
    </p>

$$\rho = 3 \times (12 - 3) = 3 \times 9 = 27$$

    <p>
    is representable as a unique pair of factors that sums to \(99\) or less.
    </p>

    <p>
    In another example, if \(77\) was whispered to \(S\) then:
    </p>

$$\sigma = 59 + 18 = 59 + (77 - 59)$$

    <p>
    and:
    </p>

$$\rho = 59 \times 18 = 1, 062$$

    <p>
    has the following pairs of factors:
    </p>

$$1 \times 1,062 \quad 2 \times 531 \quad 3 \times 354 \quad 6 \times 177
 \quad 9 \times 118 \quad 18 \times 59$$

    <p>
    looking at which \(P\) can eliminate all but the last pair and announce a
    correct answer, \(18\) and \(59\), since this is the only pair of factors
    that sums to \(99\) or less.
    </p>

    <p>
    In either case \(S\) would not be able to announce \(S_1\).
    </p>

    <p>
    However, we know that \(S\) did announce \(S_1\) from which we can draw two
    conclusions.
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>\(EF_4\): \(\sigma\) can not be expressed as a sum of two primes</dfn>
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>\(EF_5\): there does not exist such a representation of \(\sigma = p +
    (\sigma - p)\) that the product \(p \times (\sigma - p)\) is representable
    as a unique pair of factors that sum to \(99\) or less</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>5) Now we recall the Golbach's Conjecture:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>every even integer greater than \(2\) can be expressed as the sum of
    two primes</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    From \(EF_4\) and (verified for numbers \(4\) through \(98\)) Goldbach's
    Conjecture it follows that we know the parity of the sum \(\sigma\) with
    absolute certainty:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>\(EF_6\): the sum \(\sigma\) must be odd</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Out of \(96\) initial candidates for \(\sigma\):
    </p>

$$4, 5, 6, 7, 8, \dots , 99$$

    <p>
    we can now eliminate \(48\) candidates - all the natural numbers between \(4\)
    and \(99\) that are even.
    </p>

    <p>
    The candidates for \(\sigma\) now are \(48\) natural numbers each of which
    is odd:
    </p>

$$5, 7, 9, \dots 99$$

    <p>
    <br>6) From \(EF_1\), \(x\) and \(y\) are not both prime, and \(EF_4\) it
    follows that since \(2\) is prime then:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>\(EF_7\): \((\sigma - 2)\) can not be prime</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    We now step through all the \(48\) odd numbers from \(n = 5\) to \(n = 99\)
    and eliminate all those numbers for which \((n - 2)\) is prime. For example:
    </p<>

$$5 - 2 = 3$$

    <p>
    where \(3\) is prime, hence we eliminate \(n = 5\) and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    We now have only \(24\) candidates for \(\sigma\):
    </p>

$$11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53, 57, 59, 65, 67, 71, 77,
 79, 83, 87, 89, 93, 95, 97$$

    <p>
    <br>7) From \(EF_5\) we can prove that:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>\(EF_8\): \(\sigma < 55\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    We observe that for a given upper bound for \(\sigma\), \(100\), the following
    two prime numbers:
    </p>

$$47 \quad 53$$

    <p>
    sit on the "factorization cusp":
    </p>

$$47 \times 2 = 84 < 100$$
$$53 \times 2 = 106 > 100$$

    <p>
    Why does it matter and where did the magic number \(2\) come from?
    </p>

    <p>
    Let \(p\) designate a prime number. Then \(\sigma\) can be represented as
    follows:
    </p>

$$\sigma = p + (\sigma - p)$$

    <p>
    From where it follows that \(\rho\) is represented as follows:
    </p>

$$\rho = p \times (\sigma - p)$$

    <p>
    In this scenario, since \(p\) is prime, the number \((\sigma - p)\) is not.
    But then, according to PFT, \((\sigma - p)\) can be represented as a product
    of primes of which the smallest one is \(2\):
    </p>

$$\rho = p \times 2 \times q$$

    <p>
    where \(q\) collectively represents the remaining prime factors. Further, if
    \(p\) is such that:
    </p>

$$p \times 2 > 100$$

    <p>
    then the number \(2p\), treated as one possible term, is already greater than
    \(99\) and if \(2p\) is added to another greater than \(1\) number, whatever
    it is, the result is guaranteed to be:
    </p>

$$\sigma = 2p + q > 99$$

    <p>
    The remaining prime numbers in \(q\) are guaranteed to be greater than \(2\)
    guarantying that no matter what other factors from \(q\) we choose, the above
    inequality will always hold. For example:
    </p>

$$\sigma = 3p + q' > 99$$
$$\sigma = 5p + q'' > 99$$

    <p>
    and so on. This type of representation of \(\sigma\) thus ensures that at
    least one factor of the corresponding \(\rho\) will always be greater than
    \(99\) thus guarantying that the corresponding \(\sigma\) will always be
    greater than \(99\) thus invalidating \(EF_5\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Since \(p = 53\) is the smallest prime for which:
    </p>

$$p \times 2 > 100$$

    <p>
    holds, it follows that \(\sigma\) is representable as:
    </p>

$$\sigma = 53 + (\sigma - 53) = x + y$$

    <p>
    According to \(R\), \(x\) and \(y\) both must be greater than \(1\):
    </p>

$$\sigma - 53 \geqslant 2$$
$$\sigma \geqslant 55$$

    <p>
    Consequently, all such sums violate \(EF_5\) and must be eliminated. What was
    required to prove.
    </p>

    <p>
    We now have \(11\) candidates for \(\sigma\):
    </p>

$$11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 51, 53$$

    <p>
    <br>8) From the above set we can eliminate \(51\) because that number
    violates \(EF_2\) as discussed in 2.3):
    </p>

$$\sigma = 51 = 17 + 34$$
$$\rho = 17 \times 34 = 2 \times 17^2$$

    <p>
    but:
    </p>

$$17^2 > 100$$

    <p>
    and hence our candidates for \(\sigma\) are:
    </p>

$$11, 17, 23, 27, 29, 35, 37, 41, 47, 53$$

    <p>
    <br>9) From \(P_2\) and \(S_2\) we can prove that:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg">
    <dfn>\(EF_9\): \(\sigma < 33\)</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us assume the opposite:
    </p>

$$\sigma \geqslant 33$$

    <p>
    and let us assume that \(P\) announced \(P_2\). Then:
    </p>

$$\sigma - 31 \geqslant 2$$

    <p>
    as required and, after hearing \(P_2\), \(S\), examining all the possible
    pairs of numbers that sum to \(\sigma\), would come across the following
    representations:
    </p>

$$\sigma = (\sigma - 29) + 29 = (\sigma - 31) + 31$$

    <p>
    However, since both numbers, \(29\) and \(31\), are prime, \(P\), knowing
    that \(\sigma < 55\), would have realized that the following products:
    </p>

$$\rho = (\sigma - 29) \times 29$$
$$\rho = (\sigma - 31) \times 31$$

    <p>
    have a unique pair of factors that \(P\) would have been able to deduce
    using the logic similar to the one we used when proving \(EF_8\)
    (\(\sigma < 55\)).
    </p>

    <p>
    In other words, in either case \(P\) would have been able to deduce the
    correct answer to this problem while \(S\) would not have been able to
    announce \(S_2\) even after \(P_2\). But \(S\) did announce \(S_2\) and
    hence:
    </p>

$$\sigma < 33$$

    <p>
    Consequently, our candidates for \(\sigma\) are:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
11, 17, 23, 27, 29
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    <br>10) From \(EF_6\) (\(\sigma\) must be odd) it follows that, since the
    numbers that sum to \(\sigma\) must be of opposite parity, one must be even
    while the other must be odd, their product \(\rho\) must be even. Hence, if
    \(\rho\) has the following form:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\rho = 2^n \times p
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    where \(p\) is an odd prime, then \(P\) can deduce the numbers in question
    since of all the sums of the form:
    </p>

$$2^{n - i} + 2^i \times p$$
   
    <p>
    the only one that is odd (obeys \(EF_6\)) is of the form:
    </p>

$$2^n + p$$

    <p>
    Consequently, if \(\sigma\) has more than one representation of the form:
    </p>

$$2^n + p$$

    <p>
    \(S\) would not be able to announce \(S_2\) even after \(P_2\). But \(S\)
    did announce \(S_2\) and, hence, we can throw out all the numbers from (5)
    that have more than one representation of the form (6):
    </p>

$$\sigma = 11 = 2^2 + 7 = 2^3 + 3$$
$$\sigma = 23 = 2^2 + 19 = 2^4 + 7$$
$$\sigma = 27 = 2^2 + 23 = 2^3 + 19$$

    <p>
    and we now have only two candidates for \(\sigma\):
    </p>

$$17, 29$$

    <p>
    <br>11) We can eliminate \(29\) because:
    </p>

$$\sigma = 29 = 13 + (29 - 16) = 13 + 16$$
$$\rho = 13 \times 16 = 208$$
$$208 = 2 \times 104 = 4 \times 52 = 8 \times 26 = 13 \times 16$$

    <p>
    but:
    </p>

$$\sigma = 2 + 104 = 106 > 33$$
$$\sigma = 4 + 52 = 56 > 33$$
$$\sigma = 8 + 26 = 34 > 33$$

    <p>
    and since only one pair of legal factors is left, (\(13, 16\)), \(29\)
    violates \(EF_5\). 
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>12) Since only one candidate for \(\sigma\) is left, either:
    </p>

$$\sigma = 17$$

    <p>
    or this problem does not have a solution.
    </p>

    <p>
    To find out if this problem has a solution let us decompose \(\sigma\) into
    all the possible legal two-term sums, compute the corresponding \(\rho\) and
    then record only those factors of \(\rho\) that sum to an odd number:
    </p>

$$17 = 2 + 15, \quad \rho = 30 = 2 \times 15 = 5 \times 6$$
$$17 = 3 + 14, \quad \rho = 42 = 2 \times 21 = 3 \times 14 = 6 \times 7$$
$$17 = 4 + 13, \quad \rho = 52 = 4 \times 13$$
$$17 = 5 + 12, \quad \rho = 60 = 3 \times 20 = 4 \times 15 = 5 \times 12$$
$$17 = 6 + 11, \quad \rho = 66 = 2 \times 33 = 3 \times 22 = 6 \times 11$$
$$17 = 7 + 10, \quad \rho = 70 = 2 \times 35 = 5 \times 14 = 7 \times 10$$
$$17 = 8 + 9, \quad \rho = 72 = 3 \times 24 = 8 \times 9$$

    <p>
    We see that the only two numbers that multiply to a product that has only
    one pair of factors that sum to an odd number are:
    </p>

$$4, 13$$

    <p>
    Hence, \(P\) would be able to announce \(P_2\) only if (s)he was given
    \(\rho = 52\) since only then (s)he would have been able to eliminate all
    the two-term sums but one. Consequently, the answer is:
    </p>

$$x = 4$$
$$y = 13$$
$$\sigma = 17$$
$$\rho = 52$$
