    <h1>Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 1</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    A math professor \(R\)(iddler) tells two math students, \(S\)(um) and
    \(P\)(roduct), so that both can hear:
    </p>

    <p>
    - I have two non-equal natural numbers in mind: both are greater than one and
    their sum is less than \(100\). To \(P\) I will whisper their product so that
    \(S\) can not hear it (and \(R\) does). To \(S\) I will whisper their sum so
    that \(P\) can not hear it (and \(R\) does). 
    </p>

    <p>
    Later on the following dialog between \(P\) and \(S\) ensues:
    </p>

    <p>
    \(P\): I can not name these numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
    \(S\): I knew ahead of time that you would not be able to.
    </p>

    <p>
    \(P\): But then I know them!
    </p>

    <p>
    \(S\): But then so do I!
    </p>

    <p>
    Assuming that all the participants speak the truth at all times, what are
    these numbers?
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Smallest Freudenthal</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    This problem is known as the Sum and Product Problem, or an Impossible
    Problem or the Freudenthal Problem, after a German-born Dutch mathematician
    Hans Freudenthal.
    </p>

    <p>
    First published in 1969, this problem was solved in a multitude of ways.
    In this section I would like to concentrate on an activity popular in
    mathematics and physics - constructing a toy model of the problem with the
    purpose of gaining an insight into the method of its solution.
    </p>

    <p>
    Such a model should:
    </p>

    <p>
    - be as simple as possible
    </p>

    <p>
    - be as small as possible
    </p>

    <p>
    - be as abstract as possible
    </p>

    <p>
    - address the essence of the problem
    </p>

    <p>
    To construct the smallest Freudenthal Problem we will use a two-dimensional
    matrix whose rows and columns correspond to two arbitrary object types or
    properties that may or may not have a logical connection with each other.
    These two object types (or properties) may be attached to a third, external,
    object that is not captured in the matrix explicitly. For example, a month
    and a date may be attached to a person's birthday.
    </p>

    <p>
    We can view a cell of such a matrix as an intersection of a given column with
    a given row. Since a given column represents a concrete value of one object
    type and a given row represents a concrete value of the other object type,
    the meaning of the data assigned to such a cell is:
    </p>

    <p id="dbg" class="center">
    <dfn>an existence of a simultaneous agreement between two concrete values
    of the corresponding object types</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    where we will take it that the actual values that represent the above
    existence are strictly binary - a simultaneous agreement either exists or
    does not exist. Graphically we will capture the non-existence of a
    simultaneous agreement with an empty cell and a cell with a check mark in it
    will represent the existence of a simultaneous agreement.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, let one object type represent arithmetic operators: addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, etc., and let the other object type represent
    colors: red, green, blue, etc. If, being authors of a problem, we decide that
    <dfn>"red pluses exist"</dfn> then we will capture that fact in a matrix by
    placing a check mark in a cell that corresponds to the intersection of the
    <dfn>"plus"</dfn> column and the <dfn>"red"</dfn> row (Fig. a):
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp01.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 01" class="center">

    <p>
    If we decide that more <dfn>"red"</dfn> arithmetic operators exist then we
    will put a check mark in each cell of the <dfn>"red"</dfn> row that corresponds
    to a <dfn>"red operator"</dfn> column, Fig. b.
    </p>

    <p>
    If we decide that a given operator with multiple colors exists then we will
    put a check mark in each cell of the <dfn>"plus"</dfn> column that corresponds
    to a <dfn>"colored plus"</dfn> row, Fig. c.
    </p>

    <p>
    Lastly, we observe that it does not really matter which object type designates
    columns and which object type designates rows and it does not really matter
    how we capture the binary nature of the existence of a simultaneous agreement
    - instead of empty cells and check marks we might use zeros and ones just as
    well.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Model</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    For our toy model we will use the following setting:
    </p>

    <p>
    A physics professor \(A\), for \(A\)uthor, gives two students, \(S\) and
    \(P\), a mix of space and time coordinates for the exam:
    </p>

    <p>
    - The physics exam will take place on one of the days next week in one of the
    rooms ...
    </p>

    <p>
    To \(S \; A\) whispers the room number so that \(P\) can not hear it and to
    \(P \; A\) whispers the day of the week so that \(S\) can not hear it:
    </p>

    <p>
    - See you there!
    </p>

    <p>
    Later on the following (compressed) dialog between \(P\) and \(S\) ensues
    (the statements made by each party are numbered):
    </p>

    <p>
    \(P_1\): I do not know.
    </p>

    <p>
    \(S_1\): I knew that.
    </p>

    <p>
    \(P_2\): But then I know!
    </p>

    <p>
    \(S_2\): And so do I!
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Objective</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Our task is to construct the smallest Freudenthal problem that:
    </p>

    <p>
    - has a unique solution
    </p>

    <p>
    - fits the above dialog
    </p>

    <p>
    - makes it possible for us, problem solvers or <dfn>Observers</dfn> from now
    on, to say after \(S_2\): "And so do we!"
    </p>

    <p>
    which brings us to the following
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Observations</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    - there are four participants or reference frames in this problem: \(A\),
    \(P\), \(S\) and \(O\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(A\) is an author of the problem who knows both keys, \(k_p\) and \(k_s\),
    that constitute the problem's solution
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(P\) is a person who knows only \(k_p\) and deduces \(k_s\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(S\) is a person who knows only \(k_s\) and deduces \(k_p\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(O\) is a side observer who must deduce both keys
    </p>

    <p>
    - all four participants have equal access to public information (problem
    statement)
    </p>

    <p>
    - the solution paths in the reference frames of \(P, S\) and \(O\) must lead
    to a unique answer in a purely logical way without guessing
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(P, S\) and \(O\) must be able to solve the problem only at the stages
    that agree with the dialog: \(P\) should be able to announce \(P_2\) only
    after \(S_1\) and not earlier, \(S\) should be able to announce \(S_2\) only
    after \(P_2\) and not earlier, \(O\) should be able to announce the answer
    only after \(S_2\) and not earlier
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Construction</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    One way to construct the smallest Freudenthal problem is via Reverse Order
    approach. We will start with the final stage of the problem's solution when
    \(O\) announces "And so do we!" and then we will work our way backward through
    the statements \(S_2, P_2, S_1\) and \(P_1\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us designate the rooms with small natural numbers:
    </p>

$$1, 2, 3, \dots$$

    <p>
    Let us designate the days of the week by their first letters and let us use
    only the unique abbreviations:
    </p>

$$M(onday), \; T(uesday), \; W(ednesday), \; F(riday), \; S(aturday)$$

    <p>
    Let the room numbers designate the columns and the days of the week designate
    the rows. As Authors, to get a firm grip on the situation, let us design a
    problem for which the answer is "Monday, room \(1\)" or \(M1\). Consequently,
    \(1\) was whispered to \(S\) and Monday was whispered to \(P\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Then, immediately after \(O\) announces the correct answer, \(M1\), the
    corresponding region of the matrix must be just one cell \(M1\), Fig. a:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp02.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 02" class="center">

    <p>
    Let us move backward to the state <dfn>"immediately after \(S_2\)"</dfn>.
    The region of the matrix that corresponds to that state must contain the
    smallest amount of eliminable choices - after hearing \(S_2 \; O\)
    should be able to remove these choices with certainty and announce the
    correct answer.
    </p>

    <p>
    One such choice can not be \(T1\) because then \(S\) can not announce \(S_2\)
    and it can not be \(M2\) because then \(P\) can not announce \(P_2\). It
    follows then that one choice must be \(T2\). However, we can not leave the
    matrix in the state with check marks in only \(M1\) and \(T2\) because then
    \(O\) still can not deduce the answer even after \(S_2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Since \(O\) makes decisions based on the statements made by \(S\), it is the
    column that corresponds to the room number \(2\) that should be eliminated
    by \(O\) in the last step - after hearing \(S_2\), \(O\) thinks: "since a
    unique solution exists, first announced by \(P\) and now confirmed by \(S\),
    I have to eliminate all the rooms in which the physics exam can take place
    on multiple days". Such only room is the room number \(2\) - in it the
    physics exam may take place on Tuesday or Wednesday. After eliminating the
    entire "\(2\)" column, the only choice for the space and time coordinates for
    the physics exam is room \(1\), Monday.
    </p>

    <p>
    Consequently, the region of the matrix that corresponds to the state
    <dfn>"immediately after \(S_2\)"</dfn> has the check marks in the following
    cells: \(M1, T2, W2\), Fig. b:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp02.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 02" class="center">

    <p>
    Let us move backward to the state <dfn>"immediately after \(P_2\)"</dfn>.
    At this point both, \(S\) and \(O\), learn that a problem has a unique
    solution but \(S\) must announce \(S_2\) first.
    </p>

    <p>
    After hearing \(P_2\), \(S\) thinks: "aha, since a unique solution exists,
    it means that I have to eliminate all the days of the week on which the
    physics exam can take place in multiple rooms".
    </p>

    <p>
    To keep the problem as small as possible, we have to make \(S\) hesitate
    between Monday and Friday in such a way that \(S\) can eliminate the entire
    "Friday" row. To make the "Friday" row eliminable we have to place a
    check mark in that row in one extra column - a column that corresponds to
    the room number \(2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Consequently, the region of the matrix that corresponds to the state
    <dfn>"immediately after \(P_2\)"</dfn> has the check marks in the following
    cells:  \(M1, T2, W2, F1, F2\), Fig. c:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp02.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 02" class="center">

    <p>
    Let us move backward to the state <dfn>"immediately after \(S_1\)"</dfn>.
    At this point all the remaining participants learn from \(S\) that \(P\)
    never had a chance to deduce the correct answer to this problem right away.
    For \(S\) to be able to announce \(S_1\) we have to add one extra column to
    our matrix to represent the room number \(3\) and one extra row to represent
    Saturday.
    </p>

    <p>
    By placing a check mark in the cell \(M3\), we, as \(A\)uthors, are making
    sure that the physics exam can take place on Monday or Friday in multiple
    rooms so that \(S_1\) holds and \(P\) can not announce the correct answer
    to this problem right away but has to state \(P_1\) instead.
    </p>

    <p>
    By placing a check mark in the cell \(S3\) we are making sure that \(P\) can
    eliminate the entire column "\(3\)" and announce \(P_2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    By placing the check marks in the cells \(T3\) and \(W3\) we are making sure
    that \(O\) keeps hesitating until \(S_2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Since we already have enough information filled in in the matrix, \(P\) has
    no choice but to announce \(P_1\) and we claim that we have constructed the
    smallest Freudenthal problem, captured graphically in Fig. d:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp02.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 02" class="center">

    <p>
    We can now test our arrangement with forward logic in all four reference frames.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Reference Frame of \(A\):</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    - The physics exam will take place on one of the days next week in one of the
    rooms: on Monday - in rooms \(1\) or \(3\), on Tuesday and Wednesday - in
    rooms \(2\) or \(3\), on Friday - in rooms \(1\) or \(2\), on Saturday - in
    room \(3\).
    </p>

    <p>
    - To \(S\) I will whisper the room number so that \(P\) can not hear it (and
    \(A\) does). To \(P\) I will whisper the day of the week so that \(S\) can
    not hear it (and \(A\) does).
    </p>

    <p>
    - See you there!
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Reference Frame of \(P\):</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    1) \(P\) is told by \(A\) that the exam will take place on Monday. Based on
    the information available publicly, \(P\) constructs the matrix:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp03.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 03" class="center">

    <p>
    and sees that on Monday the physics exam may take place in two rooms: \(1\)
    or \(3\). Since \(P\) can not deduce the correct answer logically right away
    because of the lack of information, (s)he announces \(P_1\):
    </p>

    <p>
    - I do not know.
    </p>

    <p>
    2) \(S\) announces \(S_1\):
    </p>

    <p>
    - I knew that.
    </p>

    <p>
    3) \(P\) thinks: first of all, instead of announcing the correct answer,
    \(S\) announced \(S_1\). Consequently, at this stage of the problem's
    solution \(S\) can not logically deduce that answer.
    </p>

    <p>
    Second of all, why \(S\) is absolutely sure that I could not have possibly
    been able to deduce the correct answer to this problem right away? Because
    \(S\) was not given a room which is the only room in which the physics exam
    can take place on a certain day. Let me check this.
    </p>

    <p>
    I do not know which room was given to \(S\) but since I was told that the
    physics exam will take place on Monday, I know that it can take place in
    rooms \(1\) or \(3\). Consequently, \(S\) is given either \(1\) or \(3\).
    </p>

    <p>
    If \(S\) is given room \(1\) then, based on the constructed matrix, (s)he
    sees that if I am given Monday then I am guaranteed to hesitate between the
    rooms \(1\) and \(3\) and if I am given Friday then I am guaranteed to
    hesitate between the rooms \(1\) and \(2\). Check.
    </p>

    <p>
    If \(S\) is given room \(3\) then (s)he sees that if I am given Monday,
    Tuesday or Wednesday  then I am guaranteed to hesitate between two rooms but
    if I am given Sunday then I would definitely <dfn>not</dfn> hesitate and I
    would announce the correct answer right away - Sunday, room \(3\).
    </p>

    <p>
    But \(S\) is absolutely sure that the last scenario can not possibly occur
    and that means that \(S\) was not given room \(3\). Consequently, I can
    safely eliminate the entire column "\(3\)", which leaves me with only one
    room in which the physics exam can take place on Monday - room \(1\):
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp04.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 04" class="center">

    <p>
    I now have logically deduced the correct answer, \(M1\), and can announce
    \(P_2\):
    </p>

    <p>
    - But then I know!
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Reference Frame of \(S\):</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    1) \(P\) announces \(P_1\):
    </p>

    <p>
    - I do not know.
    </p>

    <p>
    2) \(S\) is told by \(A\) that the exam will take place in the room number
    \(1\). Based on the information available publicly, \(S\) constructs the
    matrix:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp03.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 03" class="center">

    <p>
    and sees that the physics exam may take place in that room on two days:
    Monday or Friday. Since \(S\) can not deduce the correct answer logically
    right away, \(S\) thinks:
    </p>

    <p>
    - I know that the physics exam must take place in the room number \(1\).
    However, in that room the physics exam may take place on Monday or Friday.
    Consequently, \(P\) is given either Monday or Friday. If \(P\) is given
    Monday then (s)he will hesitate between the rooms \(1\) and \(3\) and if
    \(P\) is given Friday then (s)he will hesitate between the rooms \(1\)
    and \(2\). Hm, in either case the poor sucker does not have a chance!
    </p>

    <p>
    At this point \(S\) announces \(S_1\):
    </p>

    <p>
    - I knew that.
    </p>

    <p>
    3) \(P\) announces \(P_2\):
    </p>

    <p>
    - But then I know!
    </p>

    <p>
    4) \(S\) thinks: aha, a unique solution to this problem exists. After hearing
    my statement \(S_1\), \(P\) must have eliminated either entire column "\(2\)"
    or entire column "\(3\)". \(P\) could not have eliminated column "\(2\)"
    because on each day when the physics exam may take place in room \(2\) it
    may also take place in an other room. Consequently, \(P\) must have eliminated
    column "\(3\)". Why?
    </p>

    <p>
    Because \(P\) realized that the only reason why I can be so sure that (s)he
    never had a chance of deducing the correct answer to this problem right away
    is because I was not given a room which is the only room in which the physics
    exam may take place on a certain day.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since there exists a day of the week, Saturday, on which the physics exam
    may take place in one room only, room \(3\), \(P\) deduced that I could not
    have been given room \(3\), eliminated the entire column \(3\) and announced
    \(P_2\). It means that after eliminating the entire column \(3\) I can safely
    eliminate all the days of the week on which the physics exam may take place
    in multiple rooms.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this case the only such day is Friday - after eliminating the entire
    "Friday" row the only day on which the physics exam may take place in room
    \(1\) is Monday:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp05.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 05" class="center">

    <p>
    I have deduced the correct answer, \(M1\), logically and can now announce
    \(S_2\):
    </p>

    <p>
    - And so do I!
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Reference Frame of \(O\):</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    1) We construct the matrix based on the public information given by \(A\):
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp03.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 03" class="center">

    <p>
    and observe that we can not announce the correct answer to this problem yet.
    </p>

    <p>
    2) From \(P_1\) we conclude that \(P\) is given a day of the week on which
    the physics exam can take place in multiple rooms: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
    or Friday. Also, we can not announce the correct answer to this problem yet.
    </p>

    <p>
    3) From \(S_1\) we conclude that:
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(S\) does not know the correct answer to the problem yet, which means that
    (s)he is given a room in which the physics exam may take place on multiple
    days: \(1, 2\) or \(3\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(S\) is not given a room which is the only room in which the physics exam
    may take place on a certain day:
    </p>

    <p>
    we check the matrix and see that if \(S\) is given room \(1\) then (s)he
    sees that if \(P\) is given Monday then \(P\) is guaranteed to hesitate
    between the rooms \(1\) and \(3\) and if \(P\) is given Friday then \(P\) is
    guaranteed to hesitate between the rooms \(1\) and \(2\). Consequently,
    room \(1\) could have been given to \(S\).
    </p>

    <p>
    If \(S\) is given room \(2\) then (s)he sees that if \(P\) is given Tuesday
    or Wednesday then \(P\) is guaranteed to hesitate between the rooms \(2\) and
    \(3\) and if \(P\) is given Friday then \(P\) is guaranteed to hesitate
    between the rooms \(1\) and \(2\). Consequently, room \(2\) could have been
    given to \(S\).
    </p>

    <p>
    If \(S\) is given room \(3\) then (s)he sees that if \(P\) is given Monday,
    Tuesday or Wednesday then \(P\) is guaranteed to hesitate between two rooms
    but if \(P\) is given Sunday then \(P\) would definitely <dfn>not</dfn>
    hesitate and \(P\) would announce the correct answer right away - Sunday,
    room \(3\). Consequently, room \(3\) could not have been given to \(S\) and
    we, Observers, can safely eliminate the entire column "\(3\)".
    </p>

    Purely mechanically, we scan the matrix to find all the rows that have only
    one check mark in them and then we eliminate the entire column in which the
    sole check mark is located. Consequently, after \(S_1\) this is what our
    matrix looks like:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp06.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 06" class="center">

    <p>
    and we observe that we can not announce the correct answer to this problem
    yet.
    </p>

    <p>
    4) From \(P_2\) we conclude that a unique solution for this problem exists,
    meaning that on the day of the week given to \(P\) the physics exam may take
    place in only one room. It means that at that stage of the problem's solution
    we can safely eliminate all the rows of the matrix that are either empty or
    have more than one check mark in them.
    </p>

    <p>
    In our particular case the only such row is the row that corresponds to
    Friday since on that day the physics exam may take place in the rooms \(1\)
    and \(2\). Consequently, after eliminating the entire "Friday" row, this is
    what our matrix looks like:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp07.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 07" class="center">

    <p>
    and we observe that we can not announce the correct answer to this problem
    yet as there are three days of the week on which the physics exam may take
    place in one room only: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
    </p>

    <p>
    5) From \(S_2\) we conclude that in the room number given to \(S\) the
    physics exam may take place on one day of the week only. It means that at
    that stage of the problem's solution we can safely eliminate all the columns
    that are either empty or have more than one check mark in them.
    </p>

    <p>
    In our particular case the only such column is the column that corresponds to
    the room number \(2\) since in that room the physics exam may take place on
    Tuesday or Wednesday. Consequently, after eliminating the entire "\(2\)"
    column, this is what our matrix looks like:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp08.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 08" class="center">

    <p>
    We see that after all the eliminations the only choices for the space and
    time coordinates for the physics exam are room \(1\) and Monday. Since
    we have logically deduced the correct answer to this problem, we can now
    announce:
    </p>

    <p>
    - And so do we: the physics exam will take place on Monday in room \(1\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Conclusion</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    1) We see that the only other possible final formation of check marks that
    can not be obtained from the above L-shaped formation by the means of geometric
    transformations of translation and rotation is the triangular formation:
    </p>

<img src="imgs/ommp09.png" alt="Omnia Mea Mecum Porto 09" class="center">

    <p>
    Using the above final formations it is possible to construct the Freudenthal
    problems around them at will.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>2) In our toy model there is no logically deducible relation between the
    day of the week and the room number. In the original Freudenthal problem,
    on the other hand, there is a logically deducible relation between a sum and
    a product:
    </p>

    <p>
    - factors of a given number can be used as terms that add up to a certain sum
    </p>

    <p>
    - terms of a sum can be used as factors that multiply to a certain product
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>3) A template for an analytic solution of these types of problems is the
    following one:
    </p>

    <p>
    - negate a given statement by asking when would a person not be able to
    announce that statement?
    </p>

    <p>
    - obtain certain amount of information from the above negation
    </p>

    <p>
    - negate the above information since the person did announce the statement
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, in our toy model we can negate \(P_1\) by asking when would \(P\)
    not be able to announce \(P_1\). From the constructed matrix it follows that
    if \(P\) were given Saturday then (s)he would not be able to announce \(P_1\).
    But \(P\) did announce \(P_1\) and hence (s)he could not have been given
    Saturday.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the original problem we would observe that if \(P\) were given a number
    that is a product of two primes then \(P\) would not be able to announce
    \(P_1\). However, \(P\) did announce \(P_1\) and hence (s)he was given a
    number that is not a product of two primes.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>4) A template for a mechanical or a computer-based solution of these types
    of problems is the following one:
    </p>

    <p>
    - construct a matrix that reflects the initial problem statement. A certain
    amount of additional work may be required
    </p>

    <p>
    - based on \(S_1\) find all the rows that have only one check mark in them
    and eliminate the corresponding column in its entirety
    </p>

    <p>
    - based on \(P_2\) find all rows that are either empty or have more than one
    check mark in them and eliminate these rows in their entirety
    </p>

    <p>
    - based on \(S_2\) find all the columns that are either empty or have more
    than one check mark in them and eliminate these columns in their entirety
    </p>

    <p>
    - if the final region of the matrix has no check marks at all then the
    problem has no solution
    </p>

    <p>
    - if the final region of the matrix has multiple check marks then the problem
    has multiple solutions
    </p>

    <p>
    - if the final region of the matrix has exactly one check mark then the
    problem has a unique solution
    </p>
