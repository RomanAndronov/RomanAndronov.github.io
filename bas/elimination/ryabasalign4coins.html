    <h1>Align Four Coins</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Align four coins into one contiguous row from the initial formation shown
    by moving the coins one at a time and releasing each coin at the end of the
    move if and only if it touches two other coins:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/align4coins01.png" alt="Align 4 Coins 01" class="center">

    <p>
    All the coins have the same radius and must remain in the original plane at
    all times - they can not be lifted off the table.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Solution</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    There are four coins in the original (symmetrical) formation. Let us try
    using all these coins in turn for the very first move.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, what are all the possible first moves of the coin \(c_1\)? We
    see that \(c_1\) has only two possible first moves:
    </p>
   
    <img src="imgs/align4coins02.png" alt="Align 4 Coins 02" class="center">

    <p>
    where we have indicated the original position of the coin that has been
    moved with a dashed contour rendering the moved coin in its new position in
    solid colors.
    </p>
   
    <p>
    We observe that both initial moves of \(c_1\) result in new formations of
    coins that differ from the original ones only by their orientation and not
    the structure - these formations are original diamonds that are rotated and
    shifted (translated).
    </p>

    <p>
    As such, we eliminate the coin \(c_1\) from the potential candidates for the
    first move.
    </p>

    <p>
    Due to symmetry we also eliminate the coin \(c_3\) from the potential
    candidates for the first move based on the same reasoning.
    </p>

    <p>
    It follows now that if the sequence of moves that solves the problem exists
    at all then it must begin with either the coin \(c_2\) or the coin \(c_4\).
    Due to symmetry we eliminate, say, the coin \(c_4\) and now we anticipate
    that a sequence of moves that solves the problem must begin with \(c_2\).
    </p>

    <p>
    What are all the possible first moves of \(c_2\)? We see that \(c_2\) has
    only two possible initial moves and both of these moves result in formations
    that have identical structure:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/align4coins03.png" alt="Align 4 Coins 03" class="center">

    <p>
    As such, we can safely eliminate one of the formations, the right one, for
    example, and start the elimination process again. However, this time, since
    we have just moved \(c_2\), we eliminate it from the pool of contestants.
    </p>

    <p>
    The coin \(c_1\) has three possible moves each of which results in a new
    formation that is structurally identical to the original formation:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/align4coins04.png" alt="Align 4 Coins 04" class="center">

    <p>
    As such, we eliminate \(c_1\) from the pool of candidates for the second move.
    </p>

    <p>
    The coin \(c_3\) also has only three possible moves each of which results in
    a new formation that is structurally identical to the original diamond
    formation:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/align4coins05.png" alt="Align 4 Coins 05" class="center">

    <p>
    As such, we eliminate \(c_3\) from the pool of candidates for the second move
    which leaves us with the only coin, \(c_4\).
    </p>

    <p>
    What are all the possible moves for \(c_4\)? We see that \(c_4\) has only two
    possible moves:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/align4coins06.png" alt="Align 4 Coins 06" class="center">

    <p>
    We observe that the above formations have the following feature - each
    formation can be transformed into the other one in one move. Formation \(2.1\)
    can be transformed into formation \(2.2\) by moving \(c_4\) counterclockwise
    and positioning it on the left side of \(c_1\) and \(c_2\). Conversely,
    formation \(2.2\) can be transformed into formation \(2.1\) by moving \(c_4\)
    clockwise and positioning it on top of \(c_1\) and \(c_3\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Let us analyze the \(2.2\) formation. Since the coin \(c_4\) has been just
    moved, we do not consider it.
    </p>

    <p>
    The coin \(c_3\) has three moves but they all result in the original diamond
    formation (verify). As such, we eliminate \(c_3\).
    </p>

    <p>
    The coin \(c_2\) has three moves each of which results in a new formation
    (not shown here) that is structurally different from the initial formation
    and should be investigated further. You are encouraged to construct and
    record these formations yourself. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The only remaining coin, \(c_1\), has only two possible moves of which the
    left one looks promising:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/align4coins07.png" alt="Align 4 Coins 7" class="center">

    <p>
    We observe that the centers of the coins \(c_1, c_2\) and \(c_3\) are
    collinear and that there is exactly one properly sized opening available
    between \(c_2\) and \(c_3\) - that is where we place \(c_4\) which solves
    the problem in four moves:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/align4coins08.png" alt="Align 4 Coins 8" class="center">

    <p>
    It now follows that the \(2.1\) formation also leads to a solution but in
    one extra move.
    </p>

    <p>
    We also notice that the coin \(c_3\) remained stationary at all times.
    </p>
