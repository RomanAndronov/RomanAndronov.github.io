    <h1>Roliding Bead 1</h1>

    <p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In the initial, steady, state a massless rod of length \(l\) rotating at a
    constant angular velocity \(\omega_0\) in the horizontal plane about a fixed
    vertical axis has a point mass (bead) attached to it with a thread of length
    \(l_0\):
    </p>

<img src="imgs/rlb01.png" class="center">

    <p>
    At a certain moment the thread holding the bead in position is cut. The bead
    starts sliding along the rod away from the axis of rotation without friction.
    </p>

    <p>
    1) What will the velocity of the bead relative to the rod be at the moment
    when the bead separates from and slides off the rod?
    </p>

    <p>
    2) How long will it take the bead to separate from the rod?
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Solution</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We will use the method of Lagrange to solve this problem. We will make the
    plane of rotation be the position of the system with zero potential energy.
    Consequently, since there is no friction in the system, the kinetic energy
    of the system will be composed of the kinetic energy of the bead's rotation
    and the kinetic energy of the bead's motion relative to the rod:
    </p>

$$L = T - U = T$$
$$T = \frac {J\omega_0^2}{2} + \frac {mv^2}{2}$$

    <p>
    where \(J\) is the bead's moment of inertia and \(v\) is the beads velocity
    relative to the rod.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let \(x\) be the distance of the rotating and sliding (<dfn>roliding</dfn>
    or <dfn>slitating</dfn>) bead from the axis of rotation at an arbitrary point
    of time. Then the moment of the bead's inertia at an arbitrary moment of
    time after the thread which held the bead in a fixed position was cut is:
    </p>

$$J = mx^2$$

    <p>
    Since there is no friction in the system, the angular momentum is conserved
    and from that it follows that since the rod itself is massless and has no
    angular momentum, then the angular momentum of the system is equal to the
    angular momentum of the bead:
    </p>

$$\frac {ml_0^2\omega_0^2}{2} = \frac {mx^2\omega}{2}$$

    <p>
    For the above equality to stand, it follows that as \(x\) increases then
    \(\omega\), the bead's <dfn>current</dfn> angular velocity, must decrease and
    the system, left to itself, must slow down.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here we have two options:
    </p>

    <p>
    - the system has an external input of energy tuned perfectly to keep the bead
    and the rod rotating at constant angular velocity, \(\omega_0\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - the system has no external input, it will slow down over time, the bead's
    angular velocity is a decreasing function of time
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Option 1</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In this case the Lagrangian of the system is:
    </p>

$$L = \frac {mx^2\omega_0^2}{2} + \frac {m \dot x^2}{2}$$

    <p>
    and the Euler-Lagrangian equations are:
    </p>

$$\frac {d}{dt} \frac {\partial L}{\partial \dot x} =
\frac {\partial L}{\partial x}$$
$$\frac {\partial L}{\partial \dot x} = m \dot x, \quad \frac {d(m \dot x)}{dt} = m \ddot x$$
$$\frac {\partial L}{\partial x} = mx\omega_0^2$$
$$m \ddot x = mx\omega_0^2$$
$$\begin{equation}
\ddot x = \omega_0^2 x
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    since the bead's mass remains constant at all times.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now instead of solving (1), which of course we can do without any problems,
    we use the equivalence approach or principle by observing that purely
    mathematically or arithmetically (1), a single differential equation of the
    second order, is equivalent to the pair of differential equations of the
    first order, (1) and (2), from <strong>Armies</strong> section:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\dot a = - \beta b
\end{equation}$$

$$\begin{equation}
\dot b = - \alpha a
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    From (2) for \(b\) we have:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
b = - \frac {1}{\beta} \dot a
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Differentiating (4) over time, we obtain:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\dot b = - \frac {1}{\beta} \ddot a
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Equating (3) and (5), we have:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\ddot a = \omega_0^2 a, \quad \omega_0 = \alpha = \beta
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    rendering (1) and (6) mathematically equivalent even though on the surface
    these two problems, seemingly, have nothing in common - one is a math problem
    and the other is a physics problem.
    </p>

    <p>
    Consequently, we put forward the following equivalencies:
    </p>

    <p>
    - the bead's coordinate \(x\) as measured along the rod is equivalent to the
    number of troops of the army \(A\):
    </p>

$$x \equiv a$$

    <p>
    - the bead's radial velocity relative to the rod, \(\dot x\), according to
    (2), is equivalent to the number of troops of the army \(B\):
    </p>

$$\dot x = v \equiv -\beta b = \dot a$$

    <p>
    Before we claim the solution for the this problem, however, we observe that
    in the <strong>Armies</strong> problem, in the direct flow of time, the
    magnitudes in question were diminishing while in this problem \(x\) and
    \(\dot x\) are growing.
    </p>

    <p>
    Consequently, to establish the correct equivalence between these two problems
    we must reverse the flow of time for one of them and adjust the signs of
    derivatives:
    </p>

    <p>
    - the initial number of troops \(a_0\) of the army \(A\) we correlate with
    the length of the rod \(l\) or the bead's <dfn>final</dfn> or
    <dfn>separation</dfn> magnitude of its coordinate along the rod \(x\):
    </p>

$$a_0 \equiv l$$

    <p>
    - the final number of surviving troops \(a(b = 0)\) of the army \(A\) we
    correlate with \(l_0\) or the bead's initial position on the rod:
    </p>

$$a(b = 0) \equiv l_0$$

    <p>
    - the initial number of troops \(b_0\) of the army \(B\) we correlate with
    the bead's radial velocity relative to the rod at separation time, \(v_s\),
    with its sign adjusted since the negative sign of the rate of change of the
    army \(A\)'s number of troops means that that number is diminishing while
    the bead's radial velocity relative to the rod grows with time:
    </p>

$$b_0 \equiv \frac {v_s}{\beta}$$

    <p>
    - the final number of surviving troops \(b = 0\) of the army \(B\) we
    correlate with the bead's initial radial velocity relative to the rod:
    </p>

$$b = 0 = v_0$$

    <p>
    <strong>1) Separation Velocity</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We can now answer the first question of this problem by computing the
    bead's radial velocity relative to the rod at the moment when the bead
    reaches the rod's end and flies off of it. From <strong>Armies</strong>
    equation (5)
    </p>

$$a(b = 0) = \sqrt{a_0^2 - \frac {\beta}{\alpha}b_0^2}$$

    <p>
    it follows that:
    </p>

$$l_0^2 = l^2 - \frac {\beta}{\alpha} \frac {v_s^2}{\beta^2} =$$
$$l^2 - \frac {v_s^2}{\alpha \beta} =$$
$$l^2 - \frac {v_s^2}{\omega_0^2}$$
$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{v_s = \omega_0 \sqrt{l^2 - l_0^2}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    <strong>2) Separation Time</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    To answer the second question of this problem we observe that from the
    <strong>Armies</strong> equation (19):
    </p>

$$\ln \Bigg( \frac {b}{k} + \sqrt{\frac {b^2}{k^2} + 1}\Bigg) -
 \ln \Bigg( \frac {b_0}{k} + \sqrt{\frac {b_0^2}{k^2} + 1}\Bigg) =
 -\sqrt{\alpha \beta} \; t$$

    <p>
    it follows that since:
    </p>

$$b = 0$$

    <p>
    for the bead's separation time \(t_s\) we have:
    </p>

$$- \ln \Bigg(\frac {b_0}{k} + \sqrt{\frac {b_0^2}{k^2} + 1}\Bigg) =
 - \sqrt{\alpha \beta} \; t_s$$
$$t_s = \frac {1}{\omega_0} \ln \Bigg(\frac {b_0}{k} +
 \sqrt{\frac {b_0^2}{k^2} + 1}\Bigg)$$

    <p>
    From the <strong>Armies</strong> equation (8) for \(k\) we have (we took
    \(\beta = \omega_0\)):
    </p>

$$k^2 = \frac {\alpha}{\beta}a_0^2 - b_0^2 = l^2 - \frac {v_s^2}{\omega_0^2} =$$
$$l^2 - \frac {\omega_0^2(l^2 - l_0^2)}{\omega_0^2} = l_0^2$$

    <p>
    and hence:
    </p>

$$\frac {b_0^2}{k^2} = \frac{v_s^2}{\omega_0^2 l_0^2} =
\frac {\omega_0^2(l^2 - l_0^2)}{\omega_0^2 l_0^2} = \frac {l^2}{l_0^2} - 1$$
$$\frac {b_0}{k} = \sqrt{\frac {l^2}{l_0^2} - 1}$$

    <p>
    and:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{t_s = \frac {1}{\omega_0} \ln \Bigg(\frac {l}{l_0} +
 \sqrt{\frac {l^2}{l_0^2} - 1}\Bigg)}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    <strong>3) \(x(t), \dot x(t), \ddot x(t)\)</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Lastly, from the <strong>Armies</strong> equation (11), which we adjust to
    not have the negative sign on its right hand side since the bead's velocity
    grows with time,  and the equation (18) it follows that in the direct flow
    of time we integrate from zero, the bead's initial velocity, to some arbitrary
    value \(v\), while the bead is still on the rod, we obtain:
    </p>

$$\ln \Bigg(\frac {v}{\omega_0 k} + \sqrt{\frac {v^2}{\omega_0^2 k^2} + 1}\Bigg) =
 \omega_0t$$
$$\frac {v}{\omega_0 k} + \sqrt{\frac {v^2}{\omega_0^2 k^2} + 1} = e^{\omega_0t}$$
$$\sqrt{\frac {v^2}{\omega_0^2 k^2} + 1} = e^{\omega_0t} - \frac {v}{\omega_0 k}$$
$$\frac {v^2}{\omega_0^2 k^2} + 1 = e^{2\omega_0t} -
 \frac {2e^{\omega_0t}v}{\omega_0 k} + \frac {v^2}{\omega_0^2 k^2}$$
$$\frac {2e^{\omega_0t}v}{\omega_0 k} = e^{2\omega_0t} - 1$$

$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{v(t) = \dot x(t) = \omega_0 l_0 \frac {e^{\omega_0 t} -
 e^{-\omega_0 t}}{2}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Integrating (9) to obtain \(x(t)\) and differentiating (9) to obtain
    \(\ddot x(t)\), we have:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{x(t) = l_0 \frac {e^{\omega_0 t} + e^{-\omega_0 t}}{2}}
\end{equation}$$

$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{\ddot x(t) = \omega_0^2 l_0 \frac {e^{\omega_0 t} +
 e^{-\omega_0 t}}{2}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    One way to interpret the above result is to observe that the trajectory of
    the bead that <strong>ro</strong>tates and <strong>slid</strong>es
    simultaneously (<dfn>rolides</dfn> or <dfn>slitates</dfn>) is a type of a
    logarithmic spiral:
