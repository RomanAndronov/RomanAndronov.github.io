    <h1>Mooftochka.</h1>

    <p>
    1. Based on calculus.
    </p>

    <p>
    Based on the law of conservation of angular momentum - IF there is no extra input
    of energy/forces into the system except for the one required to rotate the system at
    \(\omega_0\) in a steady state when mooftochka is at position \(a\) - as the distance
    of mooftochka from the axis of rotation grows its (and the rod's) angular velocity
    diminishes - the system must slow down.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, if I understood you correctly, this is exactly what is NOT happenning - some
    mysterious external force starts acting on the system as soon as mooftochka is set in
    motion relative to the rod. So at this point I am assuming that when you say that
    "<dfn>the rod is rotating at constant angular velocity</dfn>" - it really means a
    constant angular velocity <dfn>at all times</dfn>, even after mooftochka starts running
    along the rod.
    </p>

    <p>
    If that is not the case then what follows below is obviously wrong but I will write it
    out anyway. If the angular velocity does change in time then it will be a bit different
    problem. In that case the angular velocity of the rod would be some function of
    mooftochka's position along the rod, which itself would be some function of time. The
    coordinate would increase with \(t\) while the angular velocity would decrease with
    \(t\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Anyway, since we need to find mooftochka's velocity relative to the rod we move into its
    (rod's) reference frame which itself is not inertial - it rotates around the vertical
    axis at a constant angular velocity. Hence, the fictisious "force of inertia" is
    \(m\omega^2x\) and it is the first derivative of \(mv_x\), where \(m\) remains constant
    at all times. We choose the \(OX\) axis to run along the rod:
    </p>

$$m\omega_0^2x = \frac {d(mv_x)}{dt} = m\frac {dv_x}{dt}$$
$$v_x = \frac {dx}{dt}$$
$$\begin{equation}
\omega_0^2x = \frac {d^2x}{dt^2} = \frac {d \dot {x}}{dt}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Multiply both sides by \(dt\):
    </p>

$$\omega_0^2xdt = d \dot {x}$$

    <p>
    Multiply both sides by \(\dot {x}\) and expand its definition on the left hand side
    of the equation:
    </p>

$$\omega_0^2xdt \dot {x} = \omega_0^2xdt \frac {dx}{dt} = \dot {x} d \dot {x}$$

    <p>
    Cancel out \(dt\):
    </p>

$$\omega_0^2xdx = \dot {x} d \dot {x}$$

    <p>
    The variables are now separated, integrate both sides:
    </p>

$$\omega_0^2 \frac {x^2}{2} + C = \frac {\dot {x}^2}{2}$$

    <p>
    Find \(C\) from initial conditions of \(\dot {x}(0) = 0, x(0) = a\):
    </p>

$$\omega_0^2 \frac {a^2}{2} + C = 0$$
$$C = - \frac {a^2\omega_0^2}{2}$$

    <p>
    Back to the equation:
    </p>

$$\dot {x}^2 = \omega_0^2(x^2 - a^2)$$
$$\dot {x} = \omega_0 \sqrt{x^2 - a^2}$$

    <p>
    Separate the variables one more time:
    </p>

$$\frac {dx}{\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}} = \omega_0dt$$

    <p>
    Integrate:
    </p>

$$\int_a^x {\frac {dx}{\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}}} = \omega_0t$$

    <p>
    We calculate this integral with a substitution \(x = \cos^{-1}(u)\):
    </p>

$$\int {\frac {dx}{\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}}} = \ln(x + \sqrt{x^2 - a^2})$$
$$\int_a^x = \ln(x + \sqrt{x^2 - a^2}) - \ln(a + \sqrt{a^2 - a^2}) =$$
$$= \ln \Big( \frac {x}{a} + \sqrt{ \frac {x^2}{a^2} - 1} \Big)$$

    <p>
    To solve for \(x\) we substitute \(\frac {x}{a} = z\):
    </p>

$$\ln ( z + \sqrt{z^2 - 1}) = \omega_0t$$
$$z + \sqrt{z^2 - 1} = e^{\omega_0t}$$
$$z - e^{\omega_0t} = - \sqrt{z^2 - 1}$$
$$(z - e^{\omega_0t})^2 = z^2 - 1$$
$$z^2 - 2ze^{\omega_0t} + e^{2\omega_0t} = z^2 - 1$$
$$e^{2\omega_0t} + 1 = 2ze^{\omega_0t}$$
$$z(t) = \frac {1}{2}(e^{\omega_0t} + e^{-\omega_0t})$$
$$x(t) = \frac {a}{2}(e^{\omega_0t} + e^{-\omega_0t})$$
$$\dot {x}(t) = v_x(t) = \frac {a\omega_0}{2}(e^{\omega_0t} - e^{-\omega_0t})$$

    <p>
    From this it follows that to find the time \(T\) when mooftochka separates from
    the rod we need to solve a quadratic equation when \(x = L\) and
    \(z = e^{\omega_0t}\):
    </p>

$$\frac {2L}{a} = z + \frac {1}{z}$$
$$z^2 - \frac {2L}{a}z + 1 = 0$$
$$z = \frac {L}{a} + \sqrt{\frac {L^2}{a^2} - 1}$$
$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{T = \frac {1}{\omega_0} \ln \Big(\frac {L}{a} + \sqrt{\frac {L^2}{a^2} - 1} \Big)}$$

    <p>
    We can now find \(v_x(t = T)\):
    </p>

$$v_x(t = T) = \frac {a\omega_0}{2}(\frac {L}{a} + \sqrt{\frac {L^2}{a^2} - 1} -
\frac {1}{\frac {L}{a} + \sqrt{\frac {L^2}{a^2} - 1}})$$
$$\frac {1}{\frac {L}{a} + \sqrt{\frac {L^2}{a^2} - 1}} = 
\frac {L}{a} - \sqrt{\frac {L^2}{a^2} - 1}$$

    <p>
    because we have multiplied both sides of the fraction by
    \(\frac {L}{a} - \sqrt{\frac {L^2}{a^2} - 1}\). Finally we have:
    </p>

$$\begin{equation}
\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{V = \omega_0\sqrt{L^2 - a^2}}
\end{equation}$$

    <p>
    Another way to obtain the same result is to solve the equation (1) making \(v_x\)
    a function of \(x\) and not \(t\):
    </p>

$$\omega_0^2x = \frac {dv}{dt} = \frac {dx}{dx} \times \frac {dv}{dt} =$$
$$= \frac {dx}{dt} \times \frac {dv}{dx} = v \frac {dv}{dx}$$

    <p>
    Multiply both sides by \(dx\):
    </p>

$$\omega_0^2xdx = v dv$$

    <p>
    Integrate the left side from \(a\) to \(L\) and the right from \(0\) to \(V\) ...
    </p>

    <p>
    2. Without calculus.
    </p>

    <p>
    1). Break the motion of the rod into a series of steps. The location of mooftochka in
    the next step is pointed to by the mooftochka's velocity vector in the previous
    step. This forms a right triangle. The hypotenuse of the current triangle becomes
    just a side in the next iteration ... This looks similar to the well known
    wolf-chasing-the-rabbit problem:
    </p>

    <p>
    2). Purely mathematically - assuming that the formula for \(V\) is correct - the only
    thing I can see is that it is some form of the law of conservation of energy in disguise,
    which I can not honestly claim to remember very well. Square both sides of (2):
    </p>

$$V^2 = \omega_0^2L^2 - \omega_0^2a^2$$

    <p>
    Multiply both sides by \(\frac {m}{2}\):
    </p>

$$\frac {mV^2}{2} = \frac {m\omega_0^2L^2}{2} - \frac {m\omega_0^2a^2}{2}$$
$$\frac {m\omega_0^2a^2}{2} = \frac {m\omega_0^2L^2}{2} - \frac {mV^2}{2}$$
$$\frac {J_a\omega_0^2}{2} = \frac {J_L\omega_0^2}{2} - \frac {mV^2}{2}$$

    <p>
    or:
    </p>
 
$$- \frac {J_a\omega_0^2}{2} = - \frac {J_L\omega_0^2}{2} + \frac {mV^2}{2}$$

    <p>
    Why there should be these minus signs there the way they are - I honestly have no idea.
    And of course I did this only after finding a solution the calculus way (assuming it
    is correct).
