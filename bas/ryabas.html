    <h1>Basic Approaches</h1>

    <p>
    are small, simple and generic descriptions of <dfn>how</dfn> a potential
    solution can be found.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Small</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    is the number of words it takes to explain and time needed to comprehend the
    essence of the approach at hand.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Simple</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    is the language that defines an approach - it has no professional jargon
    and/or foreign language terms.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Generic</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    is the nature of an approach - it is field-independent making an approach
    universally applicable across disciplines that have little or nothing in common.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>Though I do not possess a rigorous mathematical proof, I think that a
    solution to any problem, if it exists, is representable as a collection or a
    chain of basic approaches carefully strung together in a particular order -
    taking one's clothes off first and then stepping into a shower is quite
    different from stepping into a shower first and then taking one's clothes off.
    </p>

    <p>
    Find here a sampling of basic approaches that I was able to identify and set
    in a concrete problem-solution context.
