    <h1>Strip Teez</h1>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    A strip of paper \(2^n\) sequentially numbered unit squares long is placed
    on a table in such a way that its left-most square, numbered as \(1\), is
    fixed at origin in the \(XOY\) plane.
    </p>

    <p>
    The strip then undergoes \(n\) like transformations as follows:
    </p>

    <p>
    - the strip is folded in half upward and its current right-most square is
    rotated counterclockwise \(180^{\circ}\) in the \(ZOX\) plane about the
    current strip's middle until it is placed on top of the strip's left-most
    square
    </p>

    <p>
    After the \(n\)-th fold is complete, the strip is one square-long along the
    \(OX\) axis with \(2^n\) squares piled one on top of the other along the
    \(OZ\) axis*:
    </p>

    <p>
    - if \(n = 1\) fold is performed then the initial length of the strip is \(2\)
    and at the end of the transformation the distribution of numbers in the
    vertical direction is:
    </p>

$$1 \quad 2$$

    <p>
    - if \(n = 2\) folds are performed then the initial length of the strip is
    \(4\) and at the end of the transformation the distribution of numbers in the
    vertical direction is:
    </p>

$$1 \quad 4 \quad 3 \quad 2$$

    <p>
    - for \(n = 3\) folds:
    </p>

$$1 \quad 8 \quad 5 \quad 4 \quad 3 \quad 6 \quad 7 \quad 2$$

    <p>
    - for \(n = 4\) folds:
    </p>

$$1 \quad 16 \quad 9 \quad 8 \quad 5 \quad 12 \quad 13 \quad 4 \quad
3 \quad 14 \quad 11 \quad 6 \quad 7 \quad 10 \quad 15 \quad 2$$

    <p>
    - for \(n = 5\) folds:
    </p>

$$1 \quad 32 \quad 17 \quad \dots$$

    <p>
    and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    * Another way to obtain the new sequence of numbers is as follows: holding
    the folded strip by its 'book' end, cut all the forward facing folds, thumb
    through the 'pages' to reveal their numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><dfn>- what type(s) of toy model emulating the actual folding process can
    be thought of?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>- given a square in the original strip numbered with the current year,
    what will its position be in the folded strip after 30 folds?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>We observe that the actual answer to the last question is irrelevant - the
    objective here is to devise a way to compute the new position of an arbitrary
    number in a folded strip after an arbitrary number of folds very fast - without
    modeling the strip's folding process.
    </p>

    <p>
    We also mention in passing that this problem may be stated in a multitude of
    alternate ways: how the squares in the folded strip must be numbered so that
    in the unfolded strip they are sequential or, conversely, if the squares of
    the folded strip are numbered sequentially, what will their sequence be in
    the unfolded strip?
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Solution</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Given the nature of this particular problem, it is obvious from the outset
    that we will be dealing with inductive reasoning which, while having its
    benefits, has a serious drawback - even if applied cautiously it may lead to
    wrong conclusions. For example, in the following problem:
    </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>what is the maximal number of plane regions formed by the line segments
    that connect \(n\) distinct points located on a circumference of a
    circle?</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    we may come to a wrong conclusion if we only look at the first \(5\) points:
    </p>

$$1 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 8 \quad 16$$

    <p>
    since it may seem that the answer to the maximal number of plane regions
    problem is the exact power of \(2\), when in reality it is something else
    entirely - <a href="http://oeis.org/A000127">A000127</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Conclusion: it is beneficial to write a software program that, while modelling
    the actual paper strip's folding process, outputs the new sequence of numbers
    for an arbitrary number of folds decided on ahead of time - given as program's
    input. To that end we come up with
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Model 1, Literal</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In this model we treat the entire process quite literally by:
    </p>

    <p>
    - emulating the paper strip with a linear container known as <dfn>array</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    - placing each number into a separate bucket in the array
    </p>

    <p>
    - recording for each number its two immediate neighbors - the one above and
    the one below:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">typedef struct
{
	int		numAbove;
	int		numBelow;
} num_t;</p>

    <p>
    Initially, all the <dfn>above</dfn> and <dfn>below</dfn> links point to \(NIL\).
    We divide the current length of the strip logically into two <dfn>halves</dfn>,
    left and right, and we perform the actual paper folding in two interconnected
    stages. In the first stage we move horizontally, along the \(OX\) axis, left
    to right, from the strip's left-most <dfn>column</dfn> (not square/number)
    toward the strip's current middle computing the ordinal position of the
    corresponding right column that is to be rotated up and over and placed on
    top of the left column.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the second stage, captured in <span id="inlncode">fold()</span>, for each
    pair of columns, we move vertically, along the \(OZ\) axis, placing the
    numbers in the given right column, stack of layers, on top of the numbers in
    the current left column, stack of layers, reversing the order of numbers in
    the right stack to reflect their folding/rotation:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">for ( currFold = 1; currFold <= nFolds; currFold++ )
{
	half = N / 2;

	for ( leftCol = 1; leftCol <= half; leftCol++ )
	{
		rightCol = N - leftCol + 1;

		fold( strip, leftCol, rightCol );
	}

	N /= 2;
} </p>

    <p>
    <dfn>Horizontal Motion</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    To compute the ordinal position of the corresponding right column, we observe
    that it is a mirror image of the current left column with respect to the
    current strip's middle. Consequently, if \(N\) is the current length of the
    strip then the distance \(d\) of the left column \(l\) from the left-most
    extremity of the strip to its middle is:
    </p>

$$d = \frac{N}{2} - l + 1$$

    <p>
    The corresponding right column \(r\) is located \(d\) units away from the
    strip's middle:
    </p>

$$r = \frac{N}{2} + d = \frac{N}{2} + \frac{N}{2} - l + 1 = N - l + 1$$

    <p>
    <dfn>Vertical Motion</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    In <span id="inlncode">fold()</span>, using the
    <span id="inlncode">numAbove</span> link, we first move vertically, upward
    along the \(OZ\) axis, to the very top layer of the given left column and
    then, in a similar fashion, we move to the very top layer of the given right
    column.
    </p>

    <p>
    Using the <span id="inlncode">numAbove</span> link we connect the number at
    the top of the left column to the number at the top of the right column.
    </p>

    <p>
    Using the <span id="inlncode">numBelow</span> link we move vertically,
    downward along the \(OZ\) axis, through the layers of the right column
    and flip the numbers' <dfn>below</dfn> and <dfn>above</dfn> links to reflect
    their folding/rotation, effectively reversing their order - the numbers in
    the right stack that used to be 'above' are now 'below' and conversely.

    <a href="https://github.com/RomanAndronov/stripteez">streepteez</a>, in the
    <span id="inlncode">sfoldlit.c</span> file.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Model 2, Linear</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In this model, instead of actually folding the strip, we keep it in a linear
    formation at all times, eliminating the need for any type of links used in
    the previous model - all we ever manipulate is C's
    <span id="inlncode">int</span>s in two arrays - an actual array that stores
    the current state of the strip and a stack.
    </p>

    <p>
    Using an array of size \(2^n\) and a stack of size \(2^{n-1}\), for each fold
    we:
    </p>

    <p>
    - reverse the numbers in the 'right' half of the strip by pushing them onto
    the stack in a right-to-left fashion: the right-most number is pushed first
    </p>

    <p>
    - insert the popped numbers at the proper location within the strip: the
    number of consecutive pops/inserts grows as:
    </p>

$$2^{currFold-1}$$

    <p>
    The length of the 'right half' of the strip remains constant at all times.
    That, partially, is what keeps the strip in a linear formation. With every
    consecutive fold, for insertion, we skip:
    </p>

$$2^{currFold-1}$$

    <p>
    items counting from the logical beginning of the strip - its left-most
    extremity or square \(1\).
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, let the initial length of the strip be \(8\):
    </p>

$$1 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 6 \quad 7 \quad 8$$

    <p>
    During the first fold, the array and the stack have the following contents:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8		8
			7
			6
			5</p>

    <p>
    We carry out \(2^{3-1}\) steps through the stack while popping, inserting
    and skipping \(2^{1-1}\) items at a time:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">1 8 2 7 3 6 4 5</p>

    <p>
    During the second fold, the array and the stack have the following contents:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">1 8 2 7 3 6 4 5		5
			4
			6
			3</p>

    <p>
    We carry out \(2^{3-2}\) steps through the stack while popping, inserting
    and skipping \(2^{2-1}\) items at a time:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">1 8 5 4 2 7 6 3</p>

    <p>
    During the last, third, fold, the array and the stack have the following
    contents:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">1 8 5 4 2 7 6 3		3
			6
			7
			2</p>

    <p>
    We carry out \(2^{3-3}\) steps through the stack while popping, inserting
    and skipping \(2^{3-1}\) items at a time:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">1 8 5 4 3 6 7 2</p>

    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Model 3, Matrix</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    In this model we manipulate the strip in two dimensions. You are encouraged
    to implement this model yourself while we will only describe the algorithm:
    </p>

    <p>
    - for the current number of rows in the matrix:
    </p>

$$2^{currFold-1}$$

    <p>
    - start from the top-most row and move downward, toward the bottom-most row
    </p>

    <p>
    - cut the current number of columns into two logical halves: left and right
    </p>

    <p>
    - reverse the numbers in the right half and place them on the very top of
    the matrix
    </p>

    <p>
    Using the strip from the previous example, here is what the matrix looks
    like before the first fold:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</p>

    <p>
    After the first fold:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">8 7 6 5
1 2 3 4</p>

    <p>
    After the second fold:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">4 3
5 6
8 7
1 2</p>

    <p>
    After the third fold:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">2
7
6
3
4
5
8
1</p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>No Modelling</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Now that we have a program that can print out a new sequence of numbers for
    an arbitrary number of folds we observe that the input and output sequences
    have a fair amount of symmetry:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1 8 5 4 3 6 7 2</p>

    <p>
    We notice that pairwise the numbers in the output sequence sum to \(9\):
    </p>

$$1 + 8 = 5 + 4 = 3 + 6 = 7 + 2 = 9 = 2^3 + 1$$

    <p>
    Let us name that pairwise sum <dfn>the output sequence's invariant</dfn> or,
    simply, <dfn>the invariant</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    We next perform the rearrangement of the parts of the problem, as this problem
    solving approach prescribes, by switching from the decimal to the binary form.
    We observe that at the end of the transformation \(8\) is taken into \(2\) and
    conversely:
    </p>

$$2_{10} = 0010_2 \to 1000_2 = 8_{10}$$

    <p>
    One simple rule that governs the above transformation that comes to mind is:
    </p>

    <p class="center">
    <dfn>divide by \(2\) then reverse the order of bits</dfn>
    </p>

    <p>
    where by reversing the order of bits we mean an equivalent geometric
    transformation of rotation of the entire bit pattern about its vertical axis
    of symmetry, after which, for example:
    </p>

$$abcd \to dcba$$

    <p>
    To take \(2\) into \(8\), in binary form, we divide \(2\) by \(2\):
    </p>

$$2_{10} \div 2_{10} \equiv 0010_2 \to 0001_2$$

    <p>
    and then we reverse the order of bits in the last \(4-\)bit long pattern:
    </p>

$$0001_2 \to 1000_2 = 8_{10}$$

    <p>
    To take \(8\) into \(2\):
    </p>

$$8_{10} \div 2_{10} \equiv 1000_2 \to 0100_2$$
$$0100_2 \to 0010_2 = 2_{10}$$


    <p>
    Though the above rule works for \(2\) and \(8\), it does not work for all
    the numbers in the input and output sequences. To address this problem, we
    observe the annoing absence of a one-to-one correspondance between the number
    of bits required to record the invariant and the number of folds - the former
    is by one larger than the latter: \(4\) versus \(3\) in the example above.
    </p>

    <p>
    If we require that the two numbers match exactly then we should switch from
    \(1-\)based counting to \(0-\)based counting, in which case the input and
    output sequences become:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
0 7 4 3 2 5 6 1</p>

    <p>
    and the invariant becomes:
    </p>

$$2^n - 1 = 0 + 7 = 4 + 3 = 2 + 5 = 6 + 1 = 7_{10} = 111_2$$

    <p>
    which means that if we know one number then we can obtain its counterpart by
    applying the C's one's compliment operator, <span id="inlncode">~</span>,
    to the given number, changing the values of all of its bits to their
    opposites: \(0\)s to \(1\)s and vice versa. For example, if \(3\) is given
    then:
    </p>

$$4 = 2^n - 1 - 3 = \text{~} (3_{10}) = \text{~} (011_2) = 100_2 = 4_{10}$$

    <p>
    Now the rule that we have discovered earlier seems to work for any and all
    the even numbers. For example, let the input \(0-\)based number be \(6\) and
    the number of foldings be \(4\):
    </p>

<p id="srccode">00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15
00 15 08 07 04 11 12 03 02 13 10 05 06 09 14 01</p>

    <p>
    Then, we first divide \(6\) by \(2\):
    </p>

$$6_{10} \div 2_{10} = 3_{10} \equiv 0110_2 \to 0011_2$$

    <p>
    and then we reverse the order of bits in the last \(4-\)bit long pattern:
    </p>

$$0011_2 \to 1100_2 = 12_{10}$$

    <p>
    We next reason that, since, by definition, \(2^n\) is necessarily even then
    \((2^n - 1)\) is necessarily odd. The only case when a sum of two natural
    numbers is odd is when the two terms are of opposite parity - one is even and
    the other is odd:
    </p>

$$2p + (2q + 1) = 2(p + q) + 1 = 2r + 1$$

    <p>
    It follows then that to compute the new position of an odd input number we
    should transform it into its even image with respect to the invariant
    \((2^n - 1)\) before reversing the order of its bits - a task that can be
    accomplished by applying the C's one's complement operator,
    <span id="inlncode">~</span>, to the odd number.
    </p>

    <p>
    Using the \(4-\)foldings strip as an example, we see that \(0-\)based \(5\)
    is taken into \(11_{10}\):
    </p>

$$5_{10} \div 2_{10} = 2_{10} \equiv 0101_2 \to 0010_2$$

    <p>
    Applying the C's one's complement operator to the last \(4-\)bit long pattern,
    we obtain:
    </p>

$$\text{~}(0010_2) = 1101_2$$

    <p>
    Reversing the order of bits in the last pattern, we obtain the output number:
    </p>

$$1101_2 \to 1011_2 = 11_{10}$$

    <p>
    <br><strong>Algorithm</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    To compute the new position of an arbitrary \(1-\)based number after an
    arbitrary number of strip's foldings are performed:
    </p>

    <p>
    - since the input number is \(1-\)based, switch to \(0-\)based counting by
    subtracting \(1\) from the input number:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">x = x - 1</p>

    <p>
    - divide the resulting number by \(2\):
    </p>

<p id="srccode">half = x >> 1</p>

    <p>
    - if <span id="inlncode">x</span> is odd then change the values of all the
    bits in <span id="inlncode">half</span> to their opposites by applying the
    C's one's complement operator to <span id="inlncode">half</span>
    (<span id="inlncode">nFolds</span> is the number of times the strip is
    folded):
    </p>

<p id="srccode">if ( x % 2 )
{
	half = ~half;
	mask = mkMask( nFolds );
	half = half & mask;
}</p>

    <p>
    where <span id="inlncode">mask</span> is needed to cut off the upper
    <span id="inlncode">(INT_BIT_SZ - nFolds)</span> bits since all the bitwise
    operations are carried out on the binary object whose size in bits is equal
    to the number of foldings performed (recall our earlier requirement); at
    the time of this writing, circa 2016,
    <span id="inlncode">INT_BIT_SZ = 32</span>
    </p>

    <p>
    - reverse the order of bits in <span id="inlncode">half</span>:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">xprime = reverseBits( half, nFolds );</p>

    <p>
    where the reversal of bits' order is performed on an
    <span id="inlncode">INT_BIT_SZ</span>-sized entity after which the resulting
    bits are shifted right <span id="inlncode">(INT_BIT_SZ - nFolds)</span> times.
    </p>

    <p>
    - add \(1\) to the result before outputting it:
    </p>

<p id="srccode">printf( "x'(%u, %u) = %u\n",
	x + 1, nFolds, xprime + 1 );</p>

    <p>
    The full source code, with comments, is at my public GitHub repository
    <a href="https://github.com/RomanAndronov/stripteez">streepteez</a>, in the
    <span id="inlncode">sfoldfind.c</span> file.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Sample Computation</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Let the input \(1-\)based number be:
    </p>

$$12_{10}$$

    <p>
    and let the strip be foled \(4\) times. Then:
    </p>

$$x = 12_{10}$$
$$x = 12_{10} - 1_{10} = 11_{10}$$
$$half = 11_{10} \div 2_{10} = 5_{10} = 0101_2$$

    <p>
    Since \(11_{10}\) is odd:
    </p>

$$half = \text{~}(0101_2) = 1010_2$$

    <p>
    Reversing the order of bits in <span id="inlncode">half</span>, we obtain:
    </p>

$$1010_2 \to 0101_2 = 5_{10}$$

    <p>
    Before outputting the answer we add \(1\) to the result:
    </p>

$$5_{10} + 1_{10} = 6_{10}$$

    <p>
    After \(4\) foldings \(12\) is taken into \(6\) and, consequently, \(6\)
