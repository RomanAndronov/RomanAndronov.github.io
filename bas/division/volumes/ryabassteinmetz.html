    <p>
    <strong>Right Circular Cylinder</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Find the volume of a Steinmetz solid formed by two right circular cylinders
    of equal radii \(r\) whose axes of rotation intersect at right angles.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Solution</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    The problem we face trying to calculate the volume of the solid in question
    is that it is not immediately obvious what type of a well-understood geometric
    object should be used as a primitive part.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the previous chapters the solids in question suggested practically
    themselves what such primitive part should be. Further, once a primitive solid
    is found the only thing that remained to be done was to position it in such a
    way that the resulting sum and limit can be computed either directly or
    indirectly.
    </p>

    <p>
    Our favorite choices have so far been rectangular prisms and right circular
    or elliptic cylinders. To find the primitive part that will solve this
    problem we observe the following.
    </p>

    <p>
    Both cylinders are right circular, both have the same radius and the
    cylinders' axis of rotation intersect at right angles. Let us fix an
    arbitrary point on any of the seems formed by the intersection of the
    cylinders. Let us say that \(A\) on \(s_1\) is such a point:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/steinmetz3d.png" alt="Steinmetz 3D" class="center">

    <p>
    If we construct a straight line \(p\) through \(A\) parallel to \(Ox\) then
    \(p\) will intersect \(s_2\) at \(B\). If we construct a straight line \(q\)
    through \(B\) parallel to \(Oy\) then \(q\) will intersect \(s_1\) at \(C\)
    and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    It follows then that the \(z\)-coordinate of \(A, B, C\) and \(D\) will be the
    same due to above mentioned symmetry:
    </p>

$$z_A = z_B = z_C = z_D$$

    <p>
    And their \(x\) and \(y\)-coordinates will only differ by the sign - not the
    magnitude:
    </p>

$$|x_A| = |x_B| = |x_C| = |x_D| = |y_A| = |y_B| = |y_C| = |y_D|$$

    <p>
    which means that \(ABCD\) is a square and that we can choose a square prism
    as a primitive part.
    </p>

    <p>
    Because the volume in question is symmetrical relative to the \(xOy\) plane
    consider, for example, its upper half - where \(z > 0\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/steinmetz2d.png" alt="Steinmetz 2D" class="center">

    <p>
    Divide \(OH\) into \(n\) line segments of equal length such that:
    </p>

$$AB = FC = ED = \frac {r}{n}$$

    <p>
    The volume of the \(i-\)th square prism then is:
    </p>

$$V'_i = BD^2 \times \frac {r}{n}$$

    <p>
    Find \(BD\) from the right, by construction, triangle \(\triangle OCD\) via
    the Pythagorean theorem:
    </p>

$$BD^2 = 4r^2 - 4OC^2 =$$
$$4r^2 - 4z_i^2 =$$
$$4r^2 - \frac {4r^2}{n^2}i^2$$

    <p>
    where we have used the fact that:
    </p>

$$OC = z_i = \frac {r}{n} \times i$$

    <p>
    Then:
    </p>

$$V'_i = \frac {4r^3}{n^3}(n^2 - i^2)$$

    <p>
    An approximate volume of the entire Steinmetz solid is the sum of volumes of
    its two halves:
    </p>

$$V' = 2 \times \sum_{i=1}^n V'_i =$$
$$\frac {8r^3}{n^3} (n^2 \sum_{i=1}^n - \sum_{i=1}^n i^2) =$$
$$\frac {8r^3}{n^3}\Big(n^3 - \frac {n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}\Big) =$$
$$\frac {8r^3}{n^3}\Big(n^3 - \frac {n^3}{6}\Big(1 + \frac{1}{n}\Big)
 \Big(2 + \frac{1}{n}\Big)\Big) =$$
$$8r^3\Big(\frac{2}{3} - \frac {1}{2n} - \frac{1}{6n^2}\Big)$$

    <p>
    Applying the corresponding limit to \(V'\) we obtain:
    </p>

$$V = \lim_{n \to +\infty} V' =$$
$$8r^3\Big(\lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{2}{3} -
 \lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac {1}{2n} -
 \lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{1}{6n^2}\Big)$$
$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{V = \frac {16}{3} r^3}$$

    <p>
    We observe that as with the volume of the hoof the irrational number \(\pi\)
    does not participate in the formula that captures the volume of the
    Steinmetz solid.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Right Elliptic Cylinders</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    If we replace the right circular cylinders with their elliptic counterparts
    with semi-major \(a\) axis and semi-minor \(b\) axis then the corresponding
    Steinmetz solid can be formed in the following ways:
    </p>

    <p>
    - when the cylinders' major axes are perpendicular while their minor axes
    are parallel:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ellipticsteinmetz1.png" alt="Elliptic Steinmetz1 3D"
    class="center">

    <p>
    <br>- when the cylinders' major axes are parallel while their minor axes are
    perpendicular:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/ellipticsteinmetz2.png" alt="Elliptic Steinmetz2 3D"
    class="center">

    <p>
    (the above drawings were created with Open SCAD and merged with GIMP)
    </p>

    <p>
    For the first case we assume that the cylinders' \(a\)-axes are perpendicular
    while their \(b\)-axes are parallel. We divide one half of the Steinmetz
    solid along the \(b\) axes into \(n\) square prisms with the same height:
    </p>

$$\frac {b}{n}$$

    <p>
    The volume of the \(i-\)th square prism then is:
    </p>

$$V'_i = 4x_i^2 \frac {b}{n}$$

    <p>
    where \(x_i\) is the \(x\)-coordinate of the \(i-\)th point on the seem of
    the intersection of two cylinders that is one of the vertexes of the \(i-\)the
    square prism.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Cartesian equation of the corresponding ellipse in the \(zOx\) plane is:
    </p>

$$\frac {x_i^2}{a^2} + \frac {z_i^2}{b^2} = 1$$
$$x_i^2 = a^2\Big(1 - \frac {z_i^2}{b^2}\Big)$$

    <p>
    and since:
    </p>

$$z_i = \frac {b}{n} \times i$$

    <p>
    for \(V'_i\) we obtain:
    </p>

$$V'_i = \frac {4a^2b}{n^3}(n^2 - i^2)$$

    <p>
    The approximate volume of the solid in question is the sum of volumes of its
    two halves:
    </p>

$$V' = 2 \times \sum_{i=1}^n V'_i =$$
$$\frac {8a^2b}{n^3}\sum_{i=1}^n (n^2 - i^2) =$$
$$8a^2b\Big(\frac{2}{3} - \frac {1}{2n} - \frac{1}{6n^2}\Big)$$

    <p>
    Applying the limit to \(V'\) as \(n \to +\infty\) we obtain:
    </p>

$$V = \lim_{n \to +\infty} V' =$$
$$8a^2b\Big(\lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{2}{3} -
 \lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac {1}{2n} -
 \lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{1}{6n^2}\Big)$$
$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{V = \frac {16}{3} a^2b}$$

    <p>
    For the second case when the \(a\)-axes are parallel while the \(b\)-axes
    are perpendicular, by analogy, we obtain:
    </p>

$$\bbox[#e8e8e8,3pt]{V = \frac {16}{3} ab^2}$$

    <p>
