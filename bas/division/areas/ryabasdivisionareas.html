    <h1>Square Areas</h1>

    <p>
    The pages that follow are a demonstration of how the Division basic approach
    may be applied to the problem of calculating the square areas under certain
    two-dimensional curves without explicit integration.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Problem</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Assume that we know that:
    </p>

    <p>
    - \(\pi = 3.14\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - the square area of a rectangle with sides \(a\) and \(b\) is \(a \times b\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - the perimeter of a circle with a radius \(r\) is \(2\pi r\)
    </p>

    <p>
    - the square area of a circle with a radius \(r\) is \(\pi r^2\)
    </p>

   <p>
$$\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac {n(n+1)}{2}$$
$$\sum_{i=1}^n i^2 = \frac {n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$
$$\sum_{i=1}^n i^3 = \frac {n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$$

     <p>
     (a uniform approach to computing the above sums is discussed in <strong>Scope
     Expansion</strong> section)
     </p><br>

$$\lim_{n \to +\infty} c = c, \quad c = const$$
$$\lim_{n \to +\infty} (a(n) \pm b(n)) = \lim_{n \to +\infty}a(n) \pm
\lim_{n \to +\infty}b(n)$$
$$\lim_{n \to +\infty} (a(n) \times b(n)) = \lim_{n \to +\infty}a(n) \times
\lim_{n \to +\infty}b(n)$$
$$\lim_{n \to +\infty} {\frac {1}{n^q}} = 0, \quad q = 1, 2, 3, \dots$$

    <p>
    Find:
    </p>

    <p>
    - the square area \(A\) of a plane region delineated by the graph of a given
    function, the \(x\)-axis and, where appropriate, the \(y\)-axis and/or
    a perpendicular to \(Ox\) through an arbitrary point \(B\) on \(Ox\).
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Solution Template</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>Division</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    The Division basic approach prescribes that we divide a given whole - a
    two-dimensional region under a graph of a function - into an arbitrary number
    of primitive parts whose square areas we do know how to compute. Let us name
    these primitive parts <dfn>Riemann Rectangles</dfn> or just
    <dfn>rectangles</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    We observe that the knowledge of how to compute the square area of a primitive
    part does inflict a certain cost on this type of solution - most of the time
    the plane region tiled over by the primitive parts and the plane region whose
    square area is sought after will <dfn>not</dfn> coincide exactly.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Construction</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We shall construct the primitive parts as follows:
    </p>

    <p>
    1) Start with and work in the first quadrant of a two-dimensional rectangular
    \(yOx\) coordinate system.
    </p>

    <p>
    2) It is not necessary but to demonstrate the mechanics of the Division basic
    approach with as modest prerequisits budget as possible divide the given
    line segment \(OB = L\) on \(Ox\) into \(n\) line segments of equal length:
    </p>

$$Ox_1 = x_1x_2 = x_2x_3 = \dots = x_{i-1}x_i = \dots = x_{n-1}x_n$$
$$x_{i-1}x_i = \Delta x = \frac {L}{n}$$
$$x_i = \Delta x \times i = \frac {L}{n} \times i, \quad i \in [1, n]$$

    <p>
    The above line segments of equal length will be used as the bases of
    primitive rectangles.
    </p>

    <p>
    3) Construct \(n\) perpendiculars to \(Ox\) - one \(v_i\) perpendicular
    through the corresponding \(x_i\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/areas01.png" alt="areas 01" class="center">

    <p>
    The corresponding portions of the above perpendiculars \(v_i\) will be used
    as the sides of primitive rectangles.
    </p>

    <p>
    4) Since the graph of a function (\(y = mx, m > 0\), in the drawing below)
    must pass a vertical line test, each of the perpendiculars \(v_i\) will
    intersect the graph of a given function at a certain point \(P_i\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Construct \(n\) perpendiculars to \(Oy\) - one \(h_i\) perpendicular through
    the corresponding intersection point \(P_i\):
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/areas02.png" alt="areas 02" class="center">

    <p>
    The corresponding portions of the above perpendiculars \(h_i\) will be used
    as the roofs of primitive rectangles.
    </p>

    <p>
    5.1) At this stage three of four vertexes of a primitive rectangle have been
    located.
    </p>

    <p>
    The remaining forth vertex may be constructed at the intersection of \(h_i\)
    with either \(v_{i-1}\) or \(v_{i+1}\).
    </p>

    <p>
    Constructing the remaining vertex at the intersection of \(h_i\) and
    \(v_{i-1}\) effectively makes each \(P_i\) an upper right vertex of the
    corresponding primitive rectangle:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/areas03.png" alt="areas 03" class="center">

    <p>
    Let us name the above primitive parts <dfn>Right Riemann Rectangles</dfn>
    and let us name the sum of their square areas a <dfn>Right Riemann Sum</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    We observe that if we number our primitive rectangles in a left to right
    fashion assigning the ordinal number of \(1\) to the left-most rectangle
    then for Right Riemann Sums the height of the \(i-\)th primitive
    rectangle will be equal to the value of the corresponding function at the
    point \(x_i\):
    </p>

$$y_i = f(x_i)$$

    <p>
    5.2) Constructing the remaining vertex at the intersection of \(h_i\) and
    \(v_{i+1}\) effectively makes each \(P_i\) an upper left vertex of the
    corresponding primitive rectangle:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/areas04.png" alt="areas 04" class="center">

    <p>
    Let us name the above primitive parts <dfn>Left Riemann Rectangles</dfn>
    and let us name the sum of their square areas a <dfn>Left Riemann Sum</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    We observe that for Left Riemann Sums the height of the \(i-\)th primitive
    rectangle will be equal to the value of the corresponding function at the
    previous point \(x_{i-1}\):
    </p>

$$y_i = f(x_{i-1})$$

    <p>
    There exist several other ways to construct primitive rectangles which differ
    from one another in a way their heights are chosen. For example, we may
    choose the height of a primitive rectangle to cut the line segments
    \(x_{i-1}x_i\) exactly in half. We may name these rectangles <dfn>Middle
    Riemann</dfn> and the sum of their square areas <dfn>Middle Riemann Sum</dfn>.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is also possible to choose the least upper bound (supremum) of a given
    function for the value of \(y_i\) for the \(i-\)th primitive rectangle. The
    sum of square areas of these <dfn>Upper Riemann Rectangles</dfn> is called
    the <dfn>Upper Riemann Sum</dfn>, \(U\). If the value of \(y_i\) is chosen
    to be the greatest lower bound of a function (infimum) then the sum of
    square areas of these <dfn>Lower Riemann Rectangles</dfn> is called the
    <dfn>Lower Riemann Sum</dfn>, \(L\):
    </p>

$$L \leqslant A \leqslant U$$

    <p>
    However, since all the functions that we will examine are monotonically
    increasing and/or monotonically decreasing in the first quadrant it is enough
    to compute the left and the right sums.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br><strong>Iterations</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    To solve the problem posed by the above inequality we will apply the
    following iterative process to each primitive part that currently covers the
    plane region in question:
    </p>

    <p>
    - reduce the magnitude of one dimension of an existing primitive part (we
    may reduce the width of a part, for example)
    </p>

    <p>
    - the above dimension reduction will result in the reduction of the overall
    area occupied by the given, now smaller, primitive part which will result
    in a gap around that primitive part
    </p>

    <p>
    - to cover that gap generate a new appropriately sized and positioned
    primitive part which will become an <dfn>"existing"</dfn> part during the
    next iteration:
    </p>

    <img src="imgs/areas05.png" alt="areas 05" class="center">

    <p>
    - capture the above process mathematically via \(n\) - the number of
    primitive parts that grows without upper bound:
    </p>

$$n \to +\infty$$

    <p>
    We  now anticipate that as \(n\) grows larger and larger the primitive parts
    delineate the plane region in question more and more precisely which, we
    hope, means that the magnitudes of the lower and upper sums get closer and
    closer to the magnitude of the actual square area \(A\) sought after.
    </p>

    <p>
    If it so happens that in the limiting case of \(n \to +\infty\) the limits
    of lower and upper sums exist and are equal to each other:
    </p>

$$\lim_{n \to +\infty}L = \lim_{n \to +\infty}U$$

    <p>
    then it is said that the above limit, known also as a <dfn>Riemann
    Integral</dfn>, is the square area sought after and the problem is solved.
    </p>

    <p>
    While we will be very thorough in the Straight Line section - read it first,
    once the basic idea of the approach is understood we will forgo the breakdown
    of a problem and go to calculations right away.
